* _2016-11-01 21:03:43_> @U2X419KJS: Great, <@U04DFTZ7D> !
* _2016-11-01 21:05:53_> @U2X419KJS: Well I would like to know if you already have a plan or we must create one
* _2016-11-01 21:07:33_> @U2X419KJS: And how is the workflow?
* _2016-11-02 09:05:43_> @U04DFTZ7D: Dear <@U2X419KJS> we have disccused the public health impact matters, but we do not yet have a plan to explore it. So if you want to create one, you are welcome :wink: Usually, when someone is intereted in exploring a specific question, we let him/her taking the lead on the topic and then we try to mobilize the community to work all together.  How would  you consider working on this topic and what would be your needs ?
* _2016-11-02 09:57:22_> @U0B47KC3S: btw, you should know that we can connect you to the eco-system of french medicine students, specialising in public health -

Maybe it would be nice to write down some first insight and then we will mobilize some member of the community to join and add feedback, ideas and such. What do you think ? We already have a few people interested in this topic.   To let you know more about the medical aspects of the project, please see this document : <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDmV-sMrCLdtwd9k11UL-t6TSR78zH596wkF8029xR8/edit> (it’s a google translated document from a workshop held at echOpen a few month ago) and i added a copy in the sharded folder.

The idea is that Institut Pasteur have developed humanised mices with liver and humanised immune system. This conference is also held by Institut Curie, one reference cancer center, which also developed animal models cc <@U0FN1B8KD>
* _2016-11-15 01:51:36_> @U0B47KC3S: Just a word of context : we have built up a working group with Institut Pasteur, in order to calibrate the future trials. We identified some pathologies : liver -&gt; cancer, differential diagnosis of liver mass and thyroid surgery -&gt; diagnosis of goitre #position #vascularisation. (reactions: @U2X419KJS,@U1NTT0ZPH)

(reactions: @U32UWGGN9)
* _2016-11-17 10:32:51_> @U32UWGGN9: Hi sure! I am happy to work with you on the public health impact. I will try to assemble the knowledge on medical aspects of the project in the near future. On the long term, I am interested in assessing the public health impact of echOpen :slightly_smiling_face: I studied at SciencesPo and a <http://M.Sc>. in epidemiology afterwards. I have expertise in epidemiologic studies and some evaluation skills. Will be happy to contribute! (reactions: @U0B47KC3S,@U04DFTZ7D,@U2X419KJS)
* _2016-11-17 23:36:43_> @U0FN1B8KD: We set the core stone for collaboration with IRD in order to investigate the interest of the echopen probe on liver applications and especially in Laos, where acces to medical imaging and anatomopathology is very scarce, and liver pathology letals (cancer and parasits in particular). This will be a 3 year clinical research project starting in september 2017 and working with IRD. With IRD researchers together, we are to prepare the protocol and apply for a european grant (Pierre et Marie Curie) . Anyone interested in this topic should not hesitate to join.
* _2016-11-17 23:57:08_> @U0B47KC3S: indeed amazing working diner :wink: besides clinical trials concerns (see <#C2MAANG0P>), some researchers gave some parasitology highlights where I learned that some parasites infects and disrupts crickets neuro-system and get them to throw themselves to water, just because they need water to complete their reproduction cycles

* _2017-01-11 18:44:36_> @U0FN1B8KD: Hello everyone ! With <@U3CDR25JP>  et <@U3N1SENJY> we have started to prepare a clinical trial. We are applying for a Pierre et Marie Curie funding for a clinical study in Lao, with a team of IRD that works on finding biological markers for hepato carcinoma diagnostic. The idea is to show the interest of echopen for liver application and moreover the follow up of liver cancer.  We wonder if we should compare echopen to a classical echograph or a Vscan, depending also of what we could have, and who would be able to come. <@U0B47KC3S>  <@U2MF267L2> <@U3Q46QRHU>, what do you think ?

* _2017-01-12 22:59:03_> @U3N1SENJY: I think we should compare Echopen to a classical echograph
* _2017-01-12 23:41:36_> @U0AAL4W13: I'd go for a vscan 
* _2017-01-12 23:42:08_> @U0AAL4W13: The echostethoscope does not have the same features as a full-fledged echograph 
* _2017-01-12 23:42:21_> @U0AAL4W13: You can't so the same things 
* _2017-01-12 23:42:48_> @U0AAL4W13: The buyer is not the same (hospitals buy echographs, medical staff buy echostethoscope) 
* _2017-01-13 09:41:14_> @U0FN1B8KD: I guess we should also have in mind what is actually possible. Could we come to Lao with an echograph ? a Vscan ? <@U04DFTZ7D>
* _2017-01-13 10:01:04_> @U3CDR25JP: I see 4 options for this trial in lao:  comparing echOpen to a standard ultrasound probe : the best approach, allows to compute sensitivity and specificity, and say at the end, echopen has revealed 95% of the hepatic tumor we found with standard probe, so it is a usefull tool…it is challenging to find a probe but worth trying I think comparing echOpen to another echostethoscope : we already have a Vscan no ? so it will be easier..It is not a standard of reference but it can be argued and it is better than nothing .. comparing echOpen by a senior VS echOpen “health profesional with 48h formation” : this would not compare echOpen but the formation and the concept of forming health professional and no longer specialist to ultrasonography, this is easy to do since we only need echopen, and the results would be of great interest, we could test several longer of formation, test nurse versus resident vs anybody, and see how they compare to each other comparing echOpen to clinical exam : our outcome can’t be hepatic tumor since clinical exams don’t detect heaptic tumor.. so what would it be? we can only test usage as mhdi said which for me I understant as asking people who used echopen questions like : do you feel this probe would help you in your everyday practice? I don’t think that it is worth doing. (reactions: @U0FN1B8KD)
* _2017-01-13 10:03:48_> @U0FN1B8KD: I guess the clinical exam is hepatomegaly
* _2017-01-13 10:05:49_> @U3CDR25JP: yes but to assess the performance you have to compare to something with higher accuracy like ultrasound probe or scanner, clinical exam is not a standard of reference to measure hepatomegaly
* _2017-01-13 10:08:58_> @U3CDR25JP: so comparing clinical exam VS echopen for hepatomegaly actually gives you information about clinical exam, how good is clinical exam for hmg compared to echopen, but it does not give you information about the performance of echopen
* _2017-01-13 10:09:39_> @U0FN1B8KD: I agree with you.
* _2017-01-13 10:10:15_> @U0FN1B8KD: I guess it is a question of means
* _2017-01-13 10:22:43_> @U0B47KC3S: yes <@U3CDR25JP> I agree largely with what you say. But, we must put this study into its context. What would be available for these populations who lack medical follow-up do not have access to a quality well structured health system. So we must have some more informations about the epidemiological context (rural populations,…). As unbelievable as it can seem, it is not rare that in some countries people are unfortunately diagnosed with huge masses, moreover I don’t dwell on co-morbidities. Anyway, I agree it is at best just a small part of the study, we should have an other comparator
* _2017-01-13 10:29:44_> @U3CDR25JP: to go in you sense a bit, I would say that I don't think that echopen VS clinical exam is interesting for a performance outcome as how well I measure hmg or how many masses I discover, because I think echopen will be better and no one doubt it and so it is not a relevant question (you might argue this:), but echopen VS clinical exams could be assess for more long term outcome, like mortality or percentage of care, to see how the diffusion of echopen in this area changes the practies and health of these patients, if at the end it benefits them or not, the issue being that I doubt there will be a specific care for HCC in lao, as you said we could detect some  cryptococcus and other infectious disease that could be cured and at the end we would see the difference ...I think though it would be much risky and probably need a very long time to be able to measure difference in our outcomes..
* _2017-01-13 10:31:11_> @U3CDR25JP: (btw Im sorry for my terrible english)

* _2017-01-16 22:15:50_> @U0FN1B8KD: Meeting today with <@U3CDR25JP>  and <@U0B47KC3S>  : Lao draft demand grant :  <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oGsaSywsreWiG4kEYWmRd-4gv6WVIFNcUJ_3Jj60c1w/edit> -still working on the protocol : do we validate echopen only on liver masses or also acite? etc.... -we will have access to an echograph there : should it be the gold standard for the trial ?
* _2017-01-16 22:46:44_> @U33817K25: <@U0B47KC3S> is the prevalence of preeclampsia so high in Madagascar, as compared with other countries with similar standard of living and access to care, that they suspect some anthropological and/or sociological factor would account for it ?
* _2017-01-16 23:13:46_> @U0B47KC3S: in fact, eclampsia is in consequence with abnormal rate of high blood pressure in Madagascra for reason that are not clear. However, number of health and dietetic advices have not been followed by pregnant women, in part for sociological reason. Moreover, representation of pregnancy seem to be rather peculiar, in such way that pregnancy is not a discussed subject till 20 weeks. What are the determinants of such behaviours in order to improve the trial design, that’s what medical anthropologists, who are numerous in Madagascar Pasteru Institute are going to explore  !
* _2017-01-16 23:48:43_> @U33817K25: OK, the main risk factor at play in Madagascar is pre-pregnancy high blood pressure
* _2017-01-17 00:20:53_> @U0B47KC3S: yes it has a lot of severe consequences -&gt; maternal complications, such as epilepsy and fetal malformations

* _2017-01-18 15:56:58_> @U0B47KC3S: the idea here is to complete direct impact measures, which can be difficult, by a better understanding of changes within behaviors, relationships of people directly involved
* _2017-01-18 16:00:15_> @U33817K25: Interesting :relaxed:
* _2017-01-19 14:30:05_> @U3T7KBEMV: excellent doc, thanks  ! the accessibility of the probe could improve all the follow up during pregnancy because it would contribute to (re)organise the follow up program in some areas and so improve détection of risk factors... and it could be the same thing with liver diseases. Managing to detect and demonstrate these outcome impact will be decisive (reactions: @U0B47KC3S)

* _2017-01-19 19:10:53_> @U3CDR25JP: Ok but I am not sure to understand what have been decided for the comparison 
* _2017-01-19 19:11:04_> @U3CDR25JP: Echopen or standard echo
* _2017-01-19 19:11:24_> @U0FN1B8KD: we are going to compare echopen to the echograph in ventiane
* _2017-01-19 19:11:35_> @U0FN1B8KD: and form health professional in laos
* _2017-01-19 19:11:53_> @U3CDR25JP: Perfect it is the best thing to do 
* _2017-01-19 19:12:05_> @U0FN1B8KD: It is our job to figure out the clinical terms of it
* _2017-01-19 19:12:15_> @U3CDR25JP: Clinical terms? 
* _2017-01-19 19:12:22_> @U3CDR25JP: What do you mean? 
* _2017-01-19 19:12:24_> @U0FN1B8KD: Am i right <@U0B47KC3S>  ? do you agree?
* _2017-01-19 19:12:35_> @U0AAL4W13: In terms of certification, will the echopen tool need to-be certified for the trial?
* _2017-01-19 19:12:44_> @U3CDR25JP: Apparently not
* _2017-01-19 19:13:01_> @U3CDR25JP: But it is a bit shameful to take advantage of this
* _2017-01-19 19:13:02_> @U0FN1B8KD: That is a question I asked eric, he is gonna check with the specialist in his team
* _2017-01-19 19:13:13_> @U3CDR25JP: Be better to have it right? 
* _2017-01-19 19:13:13_> @U0FN1B8KD: he said Lao is quite easy on this topic
* _2017-01-19 19:13:21_> @U0FN1B8KD: sure
* _2017-01-19 19:13:41_> @U3CDR25JP: How long does it take do you have an idea Emilie? 
* _2017-01-19 19:14:08_> @U0AAL4W13: Still, could be dangerous in terms of quality of the study isn'tit ?
* _2017-01-19 19:14:36_> @U0FN1B8KD: What is certain : we need to be certain it is safe, however, validation can take a while because of administrative boring stuff, so if we dont have the stamp yet but the proof maybe it is ok?
* _2017-01-19 19:15:11_> @U3CDR25JP: But I guess it can't me more than 3 month no? 
* _2017-01-19 19:15:14_> @U0FN1B8KD: he also said that we will know our specificity in terms of frequency power
* _2017-01-19 19:15:31_> @U0FN1B8KD: certinly
* _2017-01-19 19:15:37_> @U3CDR25JP: What does that mean? 
* _2017-01-19 19:15:42_> @U3CDR25JP: Frequency power
* _2017-01-19 19:15:43_> @U0FN1B8KD: I think it is never under 6 months
* _2017-01-19 19:15:55_> @U3CDR25JP: Ok
* _2017-01-19 19:16:00_> @U0FN1B8KD: the ultrasound frequency determine the power of it
* _2017-01-19 19:16:06_> @U0FN1B8KD: Am i right luc?
* _2017-01-19 19:16:10_> @U0AAL4W13: Not only in terms of safety, but also in terms of reliability 
* _2017-01-19 19:16:12_> @U0AAL4W13: Nope
* _2017-01-19 19:16:37_> @U0FN1B8KD: nope to ?
* _2017-01-19 19:16:40_> @U0AAL4W13: Whatever the frequency, you can push as much energy you any in it
* _2017-01-19 19:16:52_> @U0AAL4W13: Any = want
* _2017-01-19 19:17:09_> @U0FN1B8KD: ok
* _2017-01-19 19:17:24_> @U0FN1B8KD: then the important thing is the energy I guess and to manage it
* _2017-01-19 19:17:38_> @U0FN1B8KD: What is certain is we need to have test it completely
* _2017-01-19 19:17:50_> @U0FN1B8KD: we do not want to be dangerous!
* _2017-01-19 19:17:54_> @U0AAL4W13: I'd also emphasize on reliability 
* _2017-01-19 19:17:57_> @U3CDR25JP: Ok so we are sure it is not dangerous
* _2017-01-19 19:17:59_> @U0FN1B8KD: or take any risk
* _2017-01-19 19:18:03_> @U3CDR25JP: And reliable 
* _2017-01-19 19:18:26_> @U0FN1B8KD: we arent sure of anything yet we have not giot the finished object
* _2017-01-19 19:18:39_> @U0FN1B8KD: but we need to have test everything before 2018
* _2017-01-19 19:18:40_> @U0AAL4W13: It's not easy to work on a study with a probe that does not yield consistent results 
* _2017-01-19 19:18:48_> @U0AAL4W13: :)
* _2017-01-19 19:18:50_> @U3CDR25JP: Yeo
* _2017-01-19 19:19:17_> @U0AAL4W13: So this consistency/reliability needs to be assessed as well &gt;&lt;"
* _2017-01-19 19:19:30_> @U3CDR25JP: Plus if we want to define our outcome we need to know what we can expect to see with it.
* _2017-01-19 19:19:32_> @U0FN1B8KD: what do you mean reliability?
* _2017-01-19 19:21:18_> @U0AAL4W13: Needs to be sure for example in a wireless usage that the wireless connection can be strong enough to avoid corrupted images / disconnections 
* _2017-01-19 19:22:00_> @U0AAL4W13: And any thing that would make the study a pain (bugs, reboots, electrical failures,....) 
* _2017-01-19 19:24:13_> @U0FN1B8KD: oh yeah that is sure !!!

I talked to <@U0FN1B8KD>  yesterday and she suggested me that it could be useful to write a sort of short document about littérature context and presentation of the project. So we could have a quickly available doc for other writings (like transcan). What do you think about that ? <@U04DFTZ7D> <@U0B47KC3S> ?
* _2017-01-24 16:20:03_> @U04DFTZ7D: Thanks <@U3T7KBEMV> we might have something that meet your need. But could you be more specific ? What do you mean by litterature context ? What is transcan ? And what about the purpose of the document at the end, to make sure the document meet it's goals ? Remain at your disposal to discuss about it :wink:
* _2017-01-24 16:50:08_> @U3T7KBEMV: littérature context : papers supporting our project in different points (experience of other team about collaborative projects in health, need of echography in routine, difficulties of having such material in rural areas... (you may have lot of documents about that, the purpose of the doc wil be to make a synthesis of them) Maybe we have already that of course!  Transcan-2 is the name of the global project linked with the IRD partnership which was talking about above :slightly_smiling_face:
* _2017-01-24 17:12:38_> @U04DFTZ7D: Thanks <@U3T7KBEMV> we have <@U2MF267L2> who is currently running a meta analysis which should be ready soon on the medical littérature. Then we have some bibliography available on the wiki and soon on a repository on GitHub. And thanks for the explanation ;)

* _2017-01-26 09:51:16_> @U0AAL4W13: what they do is as follows : La première thématique d’émergence de projets de R&amp;D collaboratifs public/privé qui a été retenue concerne la « Standardisation de l’imagerie multiparamétrique échographique, et plus particulièrement de l’élastographie et de l’échographie de contraste, pour les études multicentriques des hépatopathies diffuses et des lésions primitives ou secondaires tumorales ». L’acronyme retenu pour cette initiative est SUMIL « Standardisation of Ultrasound Multiparametric Imaging for Liver».    
* _2017-01-26 09:51:52_> @U0AAL4W13: there's a call for expression of interest coming today I believe, can share this if you're interested 
* _2017-01-26 09:52:34_> @U0AAL4W13: L’objectif de cet Appel à Manifestation d’Intérêt national lancé auprès des autres pôles de compétitivité nationaux et auprès du cluster Québécois Medteq est d’identifier des partenaires académiques / cliniques et industriels qui seraient intéressés par une participation au projet. Pour ce faire, je vous invite à compléter la Fiche de Manifestation d’intérêt Excel ci-jointe et me la retourner pour le vendredi 27 janvier 2017 au plus tard.   Les organismes (public ou privé) et pôles de compétitivité qui m’auront transmis une fiche de manifestation d’intérêt seront invités à une réunion plénière d’information et de présentation mutuelle qui sera organisée chez Medicen Paris Region le jeudi 9 février à 14h00 (salle Donny Strosberg). D’autres réunions suivront et permettront de stratifier le/les consortium(s) public / privé autour de l’initiative SUMIL.

* _2017-02-01 23:00:58_> @U0FN1B8KD: That could be great ! Not on the abstract but on the detailed version, and especially in the "methods " part. But when do you think the organ recognition would be ready ? I was thinking on the data analysis of the cohort , but if it is ready could be even better !!!
* _2017-02-01 23:14:20_> @U37GZRZU6: Well for the organ recognition it depends on lots of factors... First we need a big amount of images to train the models, and also we need to test the performances on the echOpen data... <@U2PFHNN3C> do you have something to say about that? How's the request for data from the AP-HP going?
* _2017-02-01 23:26:32_> @U37GZRZU6: For the data analysis I'm not (yet?) an expert at all in medical trials, I can try to enrich that part but I really don't think I'm the best person to handle it...?
* _2017-02-01 23:49:29_> @U37GZRZU6: It depends what amount of details you need :wink:

* _2017-03-16 15:21:24_> @U0B47KC3S: hi there ! I am reviewing the whole doc of Mecovir and I have some questions about this paragraph
* _2017-03-16 15:21:25_> @U0B47KC3S: “Our primary outcome will be to assess the accuracy of echOpen used by  non-radiologist health professional, for identification of cirrhosis criterias in   chronic viral hepatitis patients clinically diagnosed with cirrhosis. We will assess   sensitivity and specificity for 6 major criterias: liver size and shape, nodular liver   surface, round edge, hypoechoic nodules in liver parenchyma, portal   hypertension signs and ascite. We will use standard ultrasonography as a   reference standard."
* _2017-03-16 15:22:45_> @U0B47KC3S: what do you have in mind with measuring sensitivity and specificity for some of these criteria such as nodular liver surface ?
* _2017-03-16 15:23:54_> @U0B47KC3S: btw, sensitivity and specificity against what ?
* _2017-03-16 15:25:39_> @U0B47KC3S: cc <@U0FN1B8KD> <@U3CDR25JP> <@U3N1SENJY>  <@U3T7KBEMV>
* _2017-03-16 15:52:28_> @U3CDR25JP: Assess the detection by echopen of a nodular liver surface (presence or absence) with sonography as reference. For example if for 100 positive sign(nodular liver surface) detected with sonography echopen detect 90 we would say echopen has 90% sensitivity 
* _2017-03-16 15:59:15_> @U3CDR25JP: The idea was to assess how useful can be echopen in the diagnoses of cirrhosis which is a more prevalent and important health problem than hcc. So I think it is a good start for echopen. These criterias are some of the most important for sonography of cirrhosis. But the final choices of which should be choosen for the study depends on the final quality of echopen and should be ask to one of our radiologist I guess 
* _2017-03-16 15:59:53_> @U3CDR25JP: (final choices of criterias) 
* _2017-03-16 17:50:20_> @U0B47KC3S: <@U3CDR25JP>  ok you test against a regular sonography. but then, what do you mean by measuring sensitivity for the size ? btw, it is not a major issue, but we should distinguish outcome and judgment criteria
* _2017-03-16 18:07:22_> @U3CDR25JP: <@U0B47KC3S> haven't really thought about it, my guess would be to define two/three categories, normal and large size, so you can say echopen has 90% sensitivity for detecting large size liver, but I don't know if it is clinically relevant, another way would be to have a error measure of the size.. but there is probably a large amount of variability between sonography... it would make the comparison diffucult, and is it clinically relevant to know that echopen measures liver with a 0.1 or .01 precision I don't know, maybe it is just simpler to say echopen detects big liver, it is a good sign for cirrhosis and thats all
* _2017-03-19 16:54:39_> @U0FN1B8KD: What i learnt this week in my medecine courses is that echography is THE gold standard to study biles conducts
* _2017-03-19 16:54:57_> @U0FN1B8KD: I dont know if it helps
* _2017-03-19 17:28:57_> @U0B47KC3S: <@U0FN1B8KD> sure ! but it still not validated for echo-stéthoscopie #murphysign
* _2017-03-19 18:27:35_> @U3CDR25JP: Are you sure your are not confounding with endo echoscopie? For bile conducts the performance of bili MRI and endo echoscopie is a lot better than echoscopy 
* _2017-03-19 19:12:50_> @U0FN1B8KD: ahha maybe, i'll check

* _2017-04-21 12:15:55_> @U3CDR25JP: <@U0B47KC3S>  do you have detailed information about what the document should look like? format, size (length), how much medical/non medical...or maybe an example of a similar work to get inspiration?
* _2017-04-21 12:38:56_> @U0B47KC3S: nice having you in <@U3CDR25JP> - I don’t have any such inspiring example but fondation Roche is looking for some document that attests the interest of echo-stethoscopy. We don’t have to go deep in medical details, but we have to give an overview of the (current and intended uses) usage and expected impact. So main items will be : interest of the techonology, current medical coverage, medical usage scheduled, medical needs (south and north), professions targeted, expected impact.
* _2017-04-21 12:40:36_> @U3CDR25JP: ok thanks !

* _2017-05-01 15:22:28_> @U0AAL4W13: Any research found already?
* _2017-05-01 15:26:41_> @U0AAL4W13: That seems a far shot, but you seem to imply that open source is cheaper and plays on the same market - which may not be the case. Ultimately,  on the side of costs, yes, if you consider that the r&amp;d costs and pi costs are zero. 
* _2017-05-01 15:26:41_> @U0AAL4W13: 
* _2017-05-01 15:28:01_> @U0FN1B8KD: "Son développement collaboratif et communautaire et son caractère open-source permettent une réduction considérable des coûts en garantissant qualité, efficacité, flexibilité et coopération entre professionnels de santé, patients, et concepteurs-techniciens."
* _2017-05-01 15:28:13_> @U0FN1B8KD: I wrote that , is it false <@U0AAL4W13> ?
* _2017-05-01 15:30:49_> @U0AAL4W13: You can also consider that opening a design lowers some barriers to entry on the market, and increases the competition. However, some key players may have secured the upstream vertical (piezo suppliers, key elements under nda, certification costs, knowledge,... )  which may prevent other competitors to enter the market -- while downstream (marketing, services, customer services,  maintenance,...)  are also important elements to factor in. You can't compete with the lumify if you don't have their level of services - unless you create a new niche.
* _2017-05-01 15:30:49_> @U0AAL4W13: 
* _2017-05-01 15:32:00_> @U0AAL4W13: I don't see the link between open source lowering costs this way :) maybe to detail?
* _2017-05-01 15:34:04_> @U0AAL4W13: A good read though: <http://openhardware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joh.4/> with excellent references
* _2017-05-01 15:34:58_> @U0FN1B8KD: haha, I have been thinking that for a year
* _2017-05-01 15:36:02_> @U0FN1B8KD: S do you think I should remove this idea?
* _2017-05-01 15:37:46_> @U0AAL4W13: The idea is that opening a design lowers a barrier (opening pcbs lowers r&amp;d) which means that it is a cost less. However, too many barriers remain to introduce a perfect competition, so it may or may not be lowering the price. Say I want to make a probe, I still need to find suppliers (some are locked!) to find a factory, to be certified, to find distribution channels,... 
* _2017-05-01 15:37:46_> @U0AAL4W13: 
* _2017-05-01 15:37:54_> @U0AAL4W13: Your call :)
* _2017-05-01 15:38:59_> @U0AAL4W13: For the repair part - there's already a market of probe repair companies existing, on which competition exists. So even on repair, the services would be easier, not necessarily hugely cheaper.
* _2017-05-01 15:38:59_> @U0AAL4W13:

* _2017-05-01 15:42:41_> @U0FN1B8KD: or <@U04DFTZ7D> ?
* _2017-05-01 15:43:08_> @U0AAL4W13: The point lies in lowering the costs and having a lower margin than the competition, in this you can be cheaper :)
* _2017-05-01 15:43:08_> @U0AAL4W13: 
* _2017-05-01 15:46:22_> @U0AAL4W13: But you still need to sell at a higher price than what it costs you. And breaking down the costs,  you'll still have some costs left. Basically you can remove some employees costs (salaries)  by having only contributions, r&amp;d costs, using alternates designs and alternates sources for materials - but you still something that remains - which may or may not be a huge difference compared to the original cost structure. 
* _2017-05-01 15:50:57_> @U0AAL4W13: Really excited to see to what proportion the impact of opening this technology can have on the final device :) (reactions: @U0FN1B8KD)

* _2017-05-01 15:57:51_> @U0AAL4W13: "I'd change reduction considerable des coûts into réduction des coûts" which is less committing :)
* _2017-05-01 16:00:04_> @U0B47KC3S: <@U0FN1B8KD> I don’t think we may go into erudition details, moreover the thoughts related to buiseness model are to my knowledge not still mature on our side - for those interested here’s where it is led <#C52LMHXQW>. The idea is to give an overview. Some simple principle can be asserted 1) open source in software (not by itself, cf. ubuntu but when supported by a community) lowers the costs 2) the R&amp;D part is distributed through the community, which lowers the cost. Btw, our approach will be to “softwarize” as much as we can. 3) On a more medical side, the idea to go to “orientation” diagnosis tool, which do not implies the same level of quality than eventual competitor, we are not on the same market than other ultrasound portable device 4) At last, an other aspect which enables lowering the cost and which is a huge source of expenses, are marketting and communication, we can hope that this will be considerably held by the community
