== '''[[:Category:Transducer|Transducer]]''' == 
*'''Objective'''
**Getting a good-resolution signal from a robust transducer, which may or may not include the following specs:
*** Immersible 
*** With a focal distance of 75mm
*** 10mm in diameter (it seems that smaller have smaller focal distance)
*** Materials : possibility to use 1-3 composite
*** if possible, low-cost !
*'''Requirements'''
**Getting a « top » to pulse
**As short as possible
**As high voltage as possible (within specs)
*'''Tests with [[:Category:Emile | Emile]]'''
**How we got the [[First Pulses (Sept. 2015)]]
** and subsequently the [[First Echoes (Sept. 2015)]]
**Produced our first transducer
