= Abstract =

A servo-control apparatus for use with equipment having a servo feedback loop, comprising an electrically energized light-emitting means or lamp, a control photosensitive device having an expansive sensing surface exposed to a portion of the light from said light-emitting means, and a movable light-control member disposed in the path of said light to controllably intercept portions thereof and thus produce defined shadowed and illuminated areas on the said sensing surface. A compensating circuit is provided, for maintaining constant the output response of the control photosensitive device for various given fixed positions of the movable light-control member. The compensating circuit includes a second or compensating photosensitive device which is positioned out of the path of light intercepted by the movable member so as to receive continuous light or excitation from the lamp. This circuit further includes an amplifier having its input connected to the compensating photosensitive device and having its output connected to the lamp to thereby control the intensity of the latter. The compensating circuit operates to maintain constant the output response of the control photosensitive device for given fixed positions of the movable member by balancing out changes which would normally occur in said output response due to such things as temperature drift, aging of both the lamp and the control photosensitive device, etc. The compensating circuit also operates to balance out changes in the output response of the control photosensitive device due to variations in the light transmission medium, such as could arise from lens fogging, or the settling of dust or debris on the lamp surface.
