= Abstract =

An ultrasonic medical diagnostic apparatus for scanning an object at a predetermined rate and generating a two-dimensional anatomical map of a plane section thereof. A position-sensing transducer develops an electrical signal corresponding to the orientation of an ultrasonic transducer. A function generator is responsive to the electrical signal for generating a voltage proportional to the rate of change of position of the ultrasonic transducer. This voltage is applied to a voltage-controlled oscillator which in turn varies the transmission rate of an ultrasonic transmitter-receiver in accordance with the scanning rate of the ultrasonic transducer. A second function generator and oscillator subsystem, together with a switch, are employed to switch to the more accurate of the two subsystems.
