# V0 Countdown

== Tuesday 22nd ==

After a WiFi problem, we shifted the Pitaya to the main room with the oscillo to do the tests. We ...
*went shopping, despite rain and fleet, and discovered [http://hackspark.fr HackSpark];
*built a housing for the probe: motor and collector were reused, from the elements of the [[IR1510AK]] probe;
*reviewed the booster, according to an article ([[Thesis: Thadani, MIT, 1997|Thadani]] et al);
*refactored an old probe piezzo ([[S-VRW77AK]]);
*synced the RedPitaya acquisition to an external trigger (the arduino).

== Wednesday 23rd ==
*Problems with existing collectors -> enhancement of existing mechanics, research of new sliprings
*Red pitaya : connection issues with the livebox
*RP : issues with the Channels - different inputs/outputs
*Red pitaya: description of the webapp at [[Red Pitaya WebApp]]
*Test of the new transducers: beginnings of the circuit by NAL at 63V to test
*Arduino Workshop @Langevinium
*RP: getting new apps to work on the code

== Thursday 24th ==
* Creating Red and Yellow from the older probe to get a testing unit
* Testing with the booster circuit : [[First Pulses (Sept. 2015)]]

== Friday 25th ==
* Waterproofing Red and Yellow

== Sunday 27th ==
* Sweeping servomotor on the [[BBB]] // [[BBB Servomotor wiring]]
*Some websites to get inspiration:
**http://www.biosono.com/ElctLgd/ElctLgd.php?id=ED_TC Transceiver 
**http://www.biosono.com/ElctLgd/ElctLgd.php?id=ED_UP Pulser
**http://echopen.org/index.php?title=File:Thesis_Insoo_Kim.pdf

== Monday 28th ==
* Testing the good quality transducer -> issues with the physical stability
*Improvising an aquarium with a soup bowl
*Playind with Red and Blue to get the  [[First Echoes (Sept. 2015)]]
*Documenting the RedPitaya issues [[The case for Red Pitaya]]
*Code to wire the servo on the arduino ([[Arduino Servomotor Wiring]]) and to synchronise pulses.

== Tuesday 29th ==


== Wednesday 30th ==
* Meeting partners at Issy les Moulineaux
* Trying ecretage / clipping filters -- at [[Clipping Test]]
* Using circuitlab to test some circuits (see above)

== Thursday 1st ==
* Finalizing the Michaud structure 
* Trying other clipping filters - [[Clipping Test]] or on CircuitLab
* News from some additional transducer suppliers
* Processing tool on the Pitaya webapp interface

= Remaining ToDo =
== High priority ==
*Synchro RP (JED 23.09)
*Montage protection double diode (NAL, 22.09)
*Circuit d'amplification (NAL, 22.09)
*Chassis + axe de rotation (JED/CAG, 01.10)
*Moteur Ard. RP (NAL, CAG, LJO, 25.09)
*Interface 2D (CAG,LJO, 25.09)
*Documentation (All, ongoing)
*Test of new, "repaired" transducers -- Out of ampli from NAL.
== Second level of priority ==
*List of equipment for V0 V0.1
*Bills of materials (
*Arduino training @Langevinium

= Documentation =
*Get a poster out of the prototype
*Get a short article
