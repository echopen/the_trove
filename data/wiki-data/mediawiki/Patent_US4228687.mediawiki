= Abstract =

In a rotating probe ultrasonic system the effective PRF may not be sufficiently high for certain purposes, such as examination of the foetal heart. The invention combines fixed transducers looking at a limited region with a rotating probe scanning over a larger region to give a higher effective PRF in the limited region. The two displays are preferably separate although the display of the larger region may conveniently indicate the location of the limited region.
