= Abstract =

The probe has a casing provided with an ultrasonically transmissive window and containing a couplant liquid in which are immersed a piezoelectric disc, an electric motor and a mechanical coupling between the motor shaft and the disc. The mechanical coupling comprises a connecting rod driven at one end by the shaft in a conical motion about the shaft axis, which is at right angles to the disc and to the window. The disc is rotatably supported about a diametrical axis which is fixedly positioned with respect to the casing. A yoke which has a bracket secured to the connecting rod at the opposite end thereof, is rotatably supported about an axis which is fixedly positioned with respect to the disc and at right angles to the diametrical axis. The mechanical coupling transmits an oscillating motion to the disc about the diametrical axis.
