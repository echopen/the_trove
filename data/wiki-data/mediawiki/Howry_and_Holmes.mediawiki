<br />
Transducer for mechanical linear scanner
(Vidoson 735)
Rotating transducer mount with three
identical periodically-activated transmitters
for the Vidoson 735 series.
The elliptic shape of the transducer is a
consequence of the opto-acoustical
characteristics of the corresponding
parabolic reflector.
