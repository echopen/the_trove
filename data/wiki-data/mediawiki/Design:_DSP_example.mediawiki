== Medical Imaging – Portable Ultrasound Systems == 

Ultrasound is a non–invasive medical imaging technique used to visualize muscles, tendons, pathological lesions and many internal organs and other structures. An ultrasound system generates and transmits high–frequency sound waves into body tissues with different acoustic impedances and captures the echoes, which are then converted into images to be displayed on a monitor. Because it uses sound waves instead of radiation, ultrasound is commonly believed to be safer than X–rays. It plays an important role during prenatal care and is commonly used as a diagnostic tool.

Portable ultrasound systems vary in size from a laptop to a handheld weighing 10 pounds or less, and can run on batteries. The device’s key attributes are the same as any portable device: size, weight, battery life, cost and performance.

With increasing demand for ultrasound diagnostic imaging, the market will be primarily driven by portable ultrasound systems, which is expanding rapidly as the functionality of these systems approaches that of cart–based systems with less costs. In 2009, the portable ultrasound systems market was valued at $739 million and by 2016 the portable ultrasound systems market is expected to reach $1.4 billion.

The basic functional building blocks of a diagnostic ultrasound imaging system are transducer, signal conditioning, TX/RX beam former, digital signal processor (DSP), power management and user interface as shown in Figure 2.

In the design of a portable ultrasound system, a low-cost FPGA is widely used to get high throughput data from analog– to–digital converters (ADCs), perform beam forming and connect to the back–end signal–processing block. After the beam former, it is generally better to move the rest of the processing onto a DSP, as its highly programmable architecture is better–suited for the remainder of the ultrasound processing, resulting in systems with better power efficiency, smaller footprints and increased flexibility.

As shown in Figure 2, a portable ultrasound system contains many components. Each of these components may have different interface requirements, creating the need for a versatile interconnect solution. Furthermore, this is becoming a more difficult problem due to increasing bandwidth requirement in the system. The combination of requirements for versatility and high bandwidth places a big burden on the component interconnection, especially in high–end ultrasound systems. Designers need a standard interface that is inexpensive and widely adopted by many customers. A PCIe backplane fits this description and can handle the high–bandwidth requirement with its established ecosystem. Figure 2 shows the PCIe interface used in modern portable ultrasound systems.

High–performance DSPs provide enough computational capability to efficiently perform all the back–end ultrasound processing for a portable ultrasound design.
