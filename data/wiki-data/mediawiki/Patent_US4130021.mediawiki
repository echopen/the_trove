= Abstract =

A sector scanning search unit which supports a transducer for oscillation about a virtual pivot axis extending medially across the face of the transducer. The scanner unit is an elongate hand held unit in which the transducer is supported near one end of a chassis. The transducer's face is oriented transversely of a longitudinal axis of the chassis and on a side of the transducer opposite its supporting structure. The sector scanner is also provided with a mechanism for readily adjusting the magnitude of the sector being scanned, even while such scanning is taking place.
