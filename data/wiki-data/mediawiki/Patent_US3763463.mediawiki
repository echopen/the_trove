= Abstract =

The invention provides an unique hand held device including a rotating transducer generating two high frequency signals which cause a nonlinear liquid to generate a low frequency signal which is then projected thru the liquid medium and a low pass filter in such a way as to direct the low frequency sound signal into animal tissue for the purpose of detecting foreign bodies located therein thru a return echo that is displayed on a cathode ray tube mounted in the device.
