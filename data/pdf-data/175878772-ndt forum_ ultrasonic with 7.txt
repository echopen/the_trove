Ultrasonic with 7.5 Mhz Transceiver and Arduino Due
Microcontroller
Greetings everyone,
Im using an Ultrasonic Transceiver model " N07 " from TMTECK (china), which is capable
of emitting frequencies up to 7.5 Mhz through objects and receiving it. I am also using an
arduino Due which has a 84Mhz Arm processor to analyse the data. By using assembly
codes I am able to program the microcontroller to produce the 7.5Mhz frequency for the
transducer but the returned signal to the receiver is too fast the the mictocontroller is
unable to comprehend it, so I decided to use decade counters to divide the frequency by
ten. five of them were used and the frequency was divided by 100,000 .
the problem I have now is that the signals received from the receiver sensor to the first
counter have many noises which are considered as pulses, hence causing wrong output
pulse durations from the first counter which is fed into the second counter and so on.
I hoping if anyone can help me with a hardware filter design to eliminate the noises and
bring the pulses to a certain level which are comprehend-able for the first counter.
any other suggestions for the whole system is highly appreciated.
thank you in advance,
cheers.

Ali,
I don't yet understand what you aim to do. Are you driving your transducer with a
continuous 7.5MHz waveform? Are you sampling and processing the received echo within
each 2/15 of a microsecond?
If you use a digital divider to reduce the pulse rate of the returned signal you lose the
amplitude information that is essential in techniques such as in this link and others from
the same source.

Dear Frank,
Yes I am able to derive 7.5Mhz to and out of the transducer but the arduino is not able to
analyse the data because the programming environment has pre-defined functions for
delay which is minimum in Microseconds.
There are many questions un-answered for me such as:
1) is the 5V output of the arduino which is fed into the transducer as pulses enough for
deriving the required frequency or do I need a transformer to increase the amplitude of
input voltage?
2) the minimum delay which is defined for the programming environment is
microseconds, is that enough for analysing and processing the signals?
3) is the decade counter suitable for this application ?
4)what sort of circuitry is required for this sort of inapection before and after the signal
transition
5)what sort of filters is it required for noise cancellation ?
Please help me understand the ultrasonic inspection requirements.
Appreciate your concern and attention,
Cheers,
Ali.

Hi Ali,
If you are working in a pulse mode you cannot just divide the frequency down by 10 and
necessarily get a good result. I am not sure how the No7 from TMTECK works, but be
aware that things could go wrong with this approach.
We sell a pulser receiver module with on board high voltage generation for the
transmitter, with software controllable gain, with 10 bit A/D conversion up to 100 MHz,
and with an SPI control port, so it should work with the Arduino Due. It has been used

Ali,
I take it that you are using a continuous wave (square wave) at 7.5MHz.
The speed of sound in steel is almost 6km per second. So, in 1 microsecond it would
have travelled just less than 6mm. At 7.5MHz, the sound would have travelled nearly
0.8mm before the next pulse of the same polarity at the transmitter.
Traditional UT work is based upon "pitch - catch" in which a single pulse is transmitted
(the transmitting piezo-electric crystal may "ring" after being hit with the electical
transmission pulse). Then, the acoustic pulse travels through the tested material until it
hits a reflector and some energy is returned to the transducer, where it produces a
voltage on the piezo-electric crystal. The time for this journey would be a lot longer than
the 2/15 of a microsecond at 7.5 MHz.
The A-Scan presentation is basically an amplitude / time display just as on an analogue
oscilloscope. Modern digital instuments run fast ADCs to capture a sequence of
measurements which record the time, amplitude and shapes of returned signals. How
fast can you run the ADC on your Arduino Due to capture that detail?
A single combined Rx/Tx crystal is often used. But, combinations of separate Tx and Rx
may be used.
In UT, defects may act as acoustic mirrors, ceate acoustic shadows or act in other ways
that replicate optical processes such as diffraction.
You will find diagrams off the way UT works on the Internet.

Frank

Dear Frank,
Yes this is the Transducer Im working with. After purchasing it I asked the seller to send
me any sort of datasheet which can give me information about it but he said it doesnt
have any datasheet ! I even asked many other sellers to see if they have datasheets but
neither of them gave me anything.
I have driven some OK results from it usning assembly language of arduino but I dont
know how much voltage do I have to supply to the transducer for it to have a clear
projection and receive of signals.
I basically have not used any circuitry for its connection. just directly the transducer to
the board. it is highly appreciated if you can guide me with what sort of circuitry is
required. I have red this article and it seems pretty in depth ! please take a look at it
and let me know your idea about it

Ali,
There are "demo boards" available for various commercial Ultrasonic pulsers, you can
find these on teh internet from various suppliers.
A very simple pulser would use a high voltage power supply (tens of volts to the low
hundreds, PLEASE TAKE CARE) to charge a capacitor through a high value resistor. The
low end of that capacitor would connect to supply 0V through a low value resistor with
the transmitting transducer connected across that resistor. A high voltage switch (bipolar

transistor or FET) is connected from the high voltage end of the capacitor to supply 0V.
The capacitor charges to the voltage of the power supply, then you give a short pulse (
from e.g. Arduino) to the base or gate of the transistor to turn it on hard. The capacitor
is discharged rapidly and puts a short high voltage pulse onto the low value resistor so
that the transducer gets a high energy kick.
The PRF of this simple circuit is limited by the time taken to recharge the capacitor, but
it gives something to experiment with.

Ali,
Here is a link to similar sort of pulser. This one free runs but, I've used avalanche
transistors as triggered fast spike generators by applying an adjustable reverse bias to
the base so that the the transistor doesnt avalanche until a forward bias pulse (AC
coupled from PIC, Arduino etc.) on the base triggers it.

Ali/Frank, here is a link to another supplier of an off-the-shelf high voltage supply for a
pulser.

I am not clear on if you are using CW or pulsed driving of the transducer...this would be
for the pulsed version. The units on that page have an output center tap feature which,
when grounded, provides both positive and negative high voltage outputs from one
module.

Hi Ali.
If you are looking up reference material on ultrasonic transmitter design, have a look at
http://www.researchgate.net/publication
/222130071_Modeling_NDT_piezoelectric_ultrasonic_transmitters. This paper gives an
overview of the design of a basic mosfet transmitter that produces a single -ve voltage
spike for driving a piezoelectric transducer. You could drive the mosfet with a +5 v pulse
from your Arduino if you select a suitable mosfet with a low gate threshold voltage, but
better to use a mosfet driver to get more current and step up the pulse to about 12 v.
The output pulse will be -ve and the voltage will be close to the voltage of your high
voltage supply - anything from 10s of volts to 100s of volts.
The width of your driving pulse should be about half the period of the frequency you
want, ie about 66 ns for 7.5 MHz. If you can make the pulse width variable with fine
resolution (probably tricky with an Arduino), you could then vary the pulse width to
optimize the response of your transducer.
The high voltage from the transmitter circuit can damage the input to your amplifier, so
you will need to include a protection circuit. Back to back shunt diodes work, but there
are better options.
I mentioned in an earlier email that we can supply a circuit that does all this and more
and could be controlled from your Arduino through the SPI port.

could you please provide a schematic of your proposed system because I was able to
develop the Avalanche circuit to provide the pulse but I couldnt develop the second part
of circuit.
furthermore, the output voltage of the Avalanche phenomena has a voltage drop which
is not desirable for this application. I need rapid pulses of 0-200 volts but in this case the
output will only be around 40V. is there any recommendation for this issue as well.
Highly appreciate your concerns.
Ali.
