All about Murgen : history
• Birth on Nov 24th: need to get a prototype by Feb ‘16. 3 possible
forks were discussed (CapTech)
– Microcontroler – a good compromise
• Analog signal processing, time efficient
– FPGA – a full processing unit
• Digital signal processing, more options, takes longer (hard + VHDL)
• Preliminary work with MCooke
– Beaglebone black – wanted to try =)
• In the pipe since September, long discussion with FLK
• The first choice went to an analog data processing / possibly using a
microcontroler
• Murgen:
– Scope: a dev kit (academics, hackers, …) – not for medical design.
– Target: release of a kit by Feb ‘16.
Why the BBB ?
• Fun and Powerful
• Possibility to add capes / shields
• Wanted to play on it, produce something
physical to play with
• A challenge: doing a board =)
• Shared memories between PRUs and CPU–
data transfer bottleneck isn’t anymore
• the nature of Linux means that real-time
control of high-speed external hardware may
often still not be easily possible. The TI chip
improves the situation by providing two
additional CPUs (known as PRU-ICSS or
PRUSSv2, I’ll call it PRU for short) on the
same silicon. It means that separate software
can be run on them, to offload hardware
interfacing and processing of low-level
protocols.
• The chip has been likened to arduino but
actually the additional CPUs run at a far
higher speed (200MHz) which in many cases
means that external logic
devices, CPLDsor FPGAs may not be
necessary.

• Open source hardware is hardware whose
design is made publicly available so that
anyone can study, modify, distribute, make,
and sell the design or hardware based on that
design. The hardware’s source, the design
from which it is made, is available in the
preferred format for making modifications to
it.
• Ideally, open source hardware uses readily-
available components and materials,
standard processes, open infrastructure,
unrestricted content, and open-source design
tools to maximize the ability of individuals to
make and use hardware.
So, what did we do ?
• A « fork and merge » idea
: the analog part is
common to all designs
• Who ?
– Inputs from lots of people:
PHH, Bertrand, Sofian,
Amit, and stack / tutos, …
• What ?
– Learning to play with
Altium,
• How ?
– Documenting hardware is
not easy =)
• Rough process:
– 11/24: Beginning
– Writing specs (the Shield
challenge)
– Getting comments
– Listing possible
components
– 12/20 : Assembling
everything
– 01/06: Getting the plans
– Assembly !

cap, TGC, ADC)
• Schematics : OK
• Gerbers: OK
– « Source files », TAPR
license
• BOM: OK
• Documentation: ~85%
• Exchanges with main
TODO
• A pulser board
• Fab
• PRUs code
• Code at large
• Node.js code
• Plugging a transducer
• Plugging the motor
• Using a µC ?
Current other lessons and todos
DONE
• Notes on the wiki
• A small experiment blog
– Creates awareness
– Drives traffic to wiki
– #2 on HackerNews!
– 25 stars on GitHub
• A ML : unused to far
• Better def. of OSH
TODO
• Polishing the wiki (or
deleting the page? – all
on github)
• Getting to know more the
OSH guys
• Sourcing fabs..
• Continue documenting
OSH / failproofing it
• Exploring CMS ?
