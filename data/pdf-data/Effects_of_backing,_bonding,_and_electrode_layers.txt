Abstract: A new laser-ultrasound technique is used
for tissue characterisation non-invasively. A fibre optic
probe with a concentric PVDF transducer receiver is
used to interrogate the tissue. In laser-ultrasound
medical probe with thickness-driven PVDF transducer,
it is necessary to have backing, electrode, and possibly,
bonding layers in the ultrasound transmission path. If
these layers have characteristic impedances that are
substantially different from those of the piezo-polymer
transducer and the front load medium, they act as
mismatched transmission line sections between the
transducer and its load, and transform the normally
real load impedance into a complex one.
The resulting shifted and deformed response curves are
computed for a large number of layer parameters by
means of MatLab™ implementation of the modified
KLM model. From these plots, information as to
permissible layer thickness, etc., may be obtained and
used in the design procedure of the medical probe.
Applying the proper parameters in the model, it was
found that for transducers made from thicker films
working at lower frequency, the effects of bonding and
electrode layers are smaller so that they do not change
the resonance peak significantly. It was also realised
that the greater are the bonding layers’ thicknesses, the
lower is the minimum insertion loss frequency.

1 Introduction
In an age where automated manufacture has
become the norm for most industry, it is perhaps
surprising to realise that the majority of ultrasound
transducers are still manufactured one at a time and
largely by hand. Indeed, the production of a high
quality transducer is almost an art rather than a
science. To some extent this derives from the fact
that the piezoelectric materials that are used as the
basis for most ultrasonic transducers, i.e. one of the
many piezoelectric ceramics, are hardly ideal for
the applications to which they are put. The result
of all this is that a wide variety of techniques have
been established that modify the performance of a
ceramic based ultrasound transducer in order to
achieve something near to the required
performance. This is especially true when we
consider ceramic transducers used for underwater
imaging or indeed in the medical environment. In
both cases the major disadvantage is the very high
acoustic impedance of piezoelectric ceramics and
the relatively low impedance of water or biological
tissue. To overcome this problem highly skilful
application of multi-layered matching materials
has evolved, but which in turn of course leads to
even more complex construction.
The problems referred to above have led to serious
investigations of the possibilities of using low
acoustic impedance materials such as
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and its derivatives
[1-3]. An immediate benefit from the adoption of
such materials for ultrasound transducers is the
much better matching into water or biological
tissue that is achieved. However, alongside this
and of almost equal importance is the fact that
transducers made from these materials can be
fashioned into very complex geometries for
focusing effects and can be made into very thin
films in order to achieve high operating
frequencies [4-7]. An important factor that must
be taken into account with polymer materials is
that very often the material thickness is very low,
leading to very high frequency operation and at
this high frequencies, one cannot assume that
electrode and bonding layers are negligibly thin
compared with the ultrasound wavelength. These
layers, therefore, act as transmission line sections
that modify the overall performance of the
ultrasonic probe [8-10].
2 Mathematical Modelling of a Multi-
layer Configuration
Mathematical models for transducers based on
ceramic materials have been around for a long time
and have proved very useful at the design stage.
They allow the transducer manufacturer to evaluate
various alternatives in order to arrive at an
optimum design without the need for a lengthy
process of experimentation. All this of course
assumes that the model is an accurate predictor of
the performance of the performance of the finished
device. It appears that this is the case for the well
known models [8, 9], but in the case of transducers
fabricated from polymer materials, there are
considerable difficulties.
One of the major departures from the standard
approach based on ceramic materials is the need to
allow for the very high internal losses of the
piezoelectric polymer materials, both of a
dielectric and an acoustic nature. These losses can
be ignored in any theoretical analysis of ceramic
transducers, but they become extremely important
when polymer materials are employed.
2.1 A Modified KLM Model with Internal
Losses
Principally, the thickness-mode transducer system
can be thought of as consisting of two λ/4
transmission lines connected back to back along
with additional transmission line segments joined
either side, as shown in Figure 1. In this circuit,
the active transducer plate is considered as two λ/4
segments in the middle, whereas the segments
either side represent bonding and electrode layers
or possible matching layers. These layers typically
have characteristic impedances that are
substantially different from those of the
piezoelectric transducer. They therefore act as
mismatched transmission line segments between
the transducer active plate and its load and backing
seen at the front and back faces of the piezoelectric
transducer respectively. In the transmission line
model, the total acoustic impedance seen at the
centre node is the parallel combination of the input
impedances of the front and the back acoustic load
lines. This total acoustic impedance is called shunt
impedance sh
Z . Using this impedance for the
distribution of acoustic power in the system,
resonance frequencies can be found by plotting
sh
Z as a function of frequency.
The three port network shown in Figure 1(b) is the
modified KLM’s equivalent circuit for the
transducer shown in Figure 1(a) [10]. This model
represents the piezoelectric element as an lossy
acoustic transmission line of the length t coupled to
a lumped network of electrical components
through a coupling transformer with a modified
turns ratio of φ*
. In this model, the transmission
line represents the acoustic part of the transducer
system. This part of the model facilitates taking
into account parameters such as the front and back
loads and also bonding and electrode layers, by
simply adding the appropriate length and acoustic
impedance to the relevant ends of the main
transmission line. The KLM equivalent circuit
would then become a centre tapped transmission
line terminated by a load with acoustic impedance
ZB at one end and a load with acoustic impedance
ZL at the other end, shown in Figure 1(b). The
lumped circuit components at the centre of the line
represent the total electrical characteristics of the
transducer, and give the frequency varying

In fact, radiation impedance is the transformed

other words, acoustic power that appears at the
acoustic part of the system is merely due to the
power delivered to the radiation impedance. The
variations of radiation impedance *
a
Z with
frequency are due to the fact that both the turns
ratio φ*
and the sh
Z are frequency dependent. In
essence, the radiation impedance is a reshaped
version of the acoustic shunt impedance. Above
equations together with the loss insertion
calculations are used to optimally design the
ultrasonic medical probe.
3 Effect of Backing Material on
Transducer Performance
The effect of backing material on the resonant
frequency of a transducer will be studied in this
section, with the aid of the modified KLM model.
Figure (2) shows that how the minimum insertion
loss frequency changes by altering the backing
material. The graph is plotted for a silver loaded
epoxy backed and water-loaded transducer made
from PVDF film. The diameter and thickness of
the PVDF disc is 6mm and 28µm, respectively.
Acoustic impedances of water, PVDF, and silver
loaded epoxy are assumed to be 1.49Mrayl,
4.02Mrayl, and 4.78Mrayl, respectively. The
minimum insertion loss frequency is the frequency
at which the minimum value for insertion loss is
achieved for a specific backing material. In this set
of theoretical results, three PVDF transducer plates
with thickness values of 9µm, 28µm, and 47µm
were considered. Here, it can be seen that for 9µm
and 28µm transducers, the minimum insertion loss
frequency varies slowly when the normalised
backing impedance value is far away from 1 and it
changes faster when the normalised backing
impedance is close to 1. For a 47µm transducer,
the minimum insertion loss frequency varies
significantly when the normalised backing value is
between 1 and 2.
The impedance analysis can also show the
variation of the resonance frequency with backing
impedance. Figure (2b) shows the variations of the
resonance frequency versus the backing
impedance, bearing in mind that the acoustic shunt
impedance is at its maximum at resonance
frequency. It can be seen that when B
Z << T
Z the
transducer will work in a half-wavelength (λ/2)
resonance and when B
Z >> T
Z the transducer will
work in a quarter-wavelength (λ/4) resonance.
4 Effect of the electrode and bonding
layers
The charge collecting metal electrodes on both
sides of the polymer film usually have much
greater acoustic impedance than that of polymer
films. Their significant mass loadings can affect
the performance of the polymer transducers by
lowering the centre frequency. The thicker the
metal layers and/or the thinner the transducer plate,
the greater the effects.
The acoustic shunt impedance and the insertion
loss calculated using the modified KLM model, are
shown in Figures (3), (4), and (5). Two NiCu
electrode layers on both sides of the PVDF film
with acoustic impedance of 51.15Mrayl are
considered. Different thicknesses of NiCu in the
range of 0 to 1µm were considered. The thickness
of a silver paint layer was assumed to be 500Å.
The other parameters for the polymer transducer
are exactly the same as the one used in section
4.3.1. It can be seen from Figure (4a)that when the
thickness of the electrode layers changes from 0 to
1µm, the resonance frequency of the 28µm
transducer changes between 40.4MHz (λ/2
frequency, f0) and 24.8MHz (0.62f0, i.e. greater
than the λ/4 frequency). Figure (3a) sows that for a
9 µm transducer with electrode layers of 1µm, the
resonance peak can even shift to below 0.5f0 (i.e.
0.47f0). In the case of the 47µm transducer the
shift of the resonance frequency is less than that of
the 28µm transducer. For the 47µm transducer, the
resonance frequency changes from 24MHz (λ/2
frequency) to 15.9MHz (0.66f0) for the range of the
electrode thickness variations (Figure 5a). Figures
(3b), (4b), and (5b) show the corresponding
insertion losses for the 9µm, 28µm, and 47µm
transducers. These figures also reveal that
minimum insertion loss frequency shifts in the
same way the acoustic resonance frequency shifts
i.e. the greater electrode thickness, the lower
minimum insertion loss frequency. It can be seen
from these plots that for transducers made from
thicker films working at lower frequencies, the
effect of electrode layers is smaller. The graphs
also show that small electrode thicknesses (less
than 1000Å) change the resonance peak negligibly.
A similar procedure, as stated above, was followed
for studying the effect of the bonding layers on the
transducer performance. All the parameters used
for the calculations are same as the last example
except than the electrode layers’ thicknesses were
assumed to be 500Å and the thickness of the
bonding layer was considered as some value
between 0Å and 5µm. The silver conductive paint
with acoustic impedance of 6.44Mrayl was
considered as a bonding layer. The acoustic shunt
impedance and the insertion loss calculated using
the modified KLM model, are shown in Figures
(6), (7), and (8), for the 9µm, 28µm, and 47µm
transducers, respectively. It can be seen from
Figures (6a), (7a), and (8a) that as the thickness of
the silver paint layer increases, the resonance peak

shifts from piezoelectric λ/2 frequency, f0, to below
0.5f0. Figure (7a) shows that when the thickness of
the silver conductive paint layer changes from 0Å
to 5µm, the resonance frequency of the 28µm
transducer changes between 40.4MHz (λ/2
frequency) and 22.8MHz (0.57f0, i.e. greater than
the λ/4 frequency). Figure (6a) shows that for a
9µm transducer with bonding layer of 1µm, the
resonance peak can even shift to below 0.5f0 (i.e.
0.40f0). In the case of the 47µm transducer the shift
of the resonance frequency is even less than that of
the 28µm transducer. For the 47µm transducer, the
resonance frequency changes from 24.0MHz (λ/2
frequency) to 15.1MHz (0.63f0) for the range of the
bonding layer thickness variations (Figure 8a).
Figures 6b, 7b, and b confirm the same fact as
previously stated about the effect of electrode
layers on the insertion loss i.e. the greater is silver
conductive paint layer’s thickness, the lower is the
minimum insertion loss frequency.
It can also be seen from these plots that for
transducers made from thicker films working at
lower frequencies, the effect of bonding layer is
smaller. The graphs also show that small bonding
thicknesses (less than 2500Å) do not change the
resonance peak significantly.
5 Conclusion
It has been shown that the design of the medical
ultrasonic detection system is a complex task with
many variables to consider. Some of these
variables are piezoelectric material, probe
diameter, thickness of the bonding and electrode
layers, type of the material used for bonding and
electrode layers, the impedance of the detection
system, and the type of the material used as
backing. All these parameters were considered
during the simulation procedure with the aid of a
KLM model. MatLab code of the KLM model
was implemented to predict precisely the
performance of the probe. As a result, a PVDF
disc with the thickness of 28µm and NiCu coating
of less than 1000Å on the surface of the PVDF
film was chosen as the transducer. Liquid silver
conductive paint with the thickness less than
2500Å was used to form electrical connections for
the front electrode of the sensor. A high-viscose
silver loaded epoxy that is acoustically matched to
the PVDF, was used as the backing material.
