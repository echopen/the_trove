Ultrasound Background
•Ultrasound devices use a pulse-echo imaging technique with sound
frequencies above human hearing limit
•Piezoelectric transducer generates an ultrasonic pulse
-Echoes occur as ultrasonic pulse passes between diﬀerent media
-Timing of echo receptions yield distance to media interfaces
•Axial resolution is inversely proportional to frequency
-Medical ultrasound devices typically operate in the MHz range to
achieve resolution of less than 1mm
A-scan Biometry
•A-scan biometry is a 1D ultrasound that measures axial lengths
between components within the eye. Measurements are used to
calculate the power of a lens to be implanted during cataract surgery.
•Typical A-scan operating frequency is 10MHz
-Average velocity of sound in eye = 1,500 m/s
-Average eye length = 23.6 mm

Project Objectives
•Create a portable A-scan ultrasound device using an iOS device as the
user interface and patient data repository
•Achieve lower device cost by using a doctor’s existing hardware
(iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch)
•Demonstrate an improved user interface over existing devices
•Simplify sharing of scan data between doctors and to patients

HV Pulser
MAX4940 High-Voltage Digital Pulser
HV Pulser
•Generates a high-voltage, high-frequency, unipolar pulse from a logic-
level voltage pulse
•Satisfies pulsing frequencies necessary for ultrasound applications
•High-impedance output during non-pulse intervals to allow echoing
pulses to drive the transmit/receive line
•Will transmit a +30V, 50ns pulse every second while scanning
•A 50ns pulse width corresponds to a unipolar 10MHz half-period
Transducer Probe Physics
•Ceramic crystal undergoes mechanical vibration when stimulated by
electrical energy
•Longitudinal ultrasound beam propagates through material
•Pulses are partially reflected back at interfaces of diﬀerent material
•Returning (echoed) mechanical vibrations transduce back into
electrical signals sent to receiver
•Damping material attached to back of crystal shortens pulse width and
improves axial resolution
Transducer Probe Physics
Transducer Probe
•DGH 6000 Scanmate A Transducer

diﬀerent performance and power
requirements
Analog Front End (AFE)
AFE5801 Analog Front End Chip
Analog Front End (AFE)
•Receives echoed voltage signal

•Variable Gain Amplifiers
