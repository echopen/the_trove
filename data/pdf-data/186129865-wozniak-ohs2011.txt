OPEN-SOURCING THE
ENGINEERING (DESIGN)
PROCESS

FIRST OFF, WHAT IS THE ENGINEERING
PROCESS?
great idea

a miracle
occurs!
fabrication
and
assembly
hardware
IT’S ALL OF THIS.
THE IDEA OF A DOCUMENTING A PROCESS IS
DEAD SIMPLE. ACTUALLY DOCUMENTING A
SPECIFIC PROCESS IS INCREDIBLY HARD.

SCHEMATICS, GERBERS AND BOMS ARE A
SUFFICIENT FOR MANUFACTURING. WHY
BOTHER WITH A PROCESS? SHOULDN’T WHAT
WE MAKE BE ENOUGH?
WHAT’S SO OPEN ABOUT YOUR
HARDWARE IF I HAVE TO REVERSE-
ENGINEER IT TO CONTRIBUTE?
INDUSTRY IS SO SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE
UNDERNEATH ALL THE NDAS, EVERYTHING IS
EXPOSED.
IN ADDITION TO BEING OPEN, FORMAL DESIGN
PROCESSES OFTEN SAVE YOUR BACON
SURE, SOCIETY COULD COLLAPSE FROM
INSUFFICIENT DOCUMENTATION.
DON’T LET THAT INTIMIDATE YOU.
THIS IS THE STORIED ENGINEERING PROCESS
LATHER. RINSE. REPEAT.
THAT’S IT.
PROJECT GOAL: AUTONOMOUS ROBOT
FIRST, I ASKED SOME QUESTIONS…
 Why are we making this?
 Who is this for?
 How will this be used?
 What features does it need to have (now)?
 What features does it need to have (later)?
 What are the legacy requirements?
 Who’s going to build this?
 How many do we want to make?
 What is the budget?
 What is the timeline?
ALL THE ANSWERS POINTED TO MAKING A
SHIELD FOR THE ARDUINO MEGA.
 All the benefits of open-source hardware
 Enough resources to get the job done
I GROUPED THE REQUIRED FEATURES INTO A
BLOCK DIAGRAM AND LOOKED FOR EXISTING
SOLUTIONS – REDUCE, REUSE, RECYCLE
 application notes
 vendor datasheets
 old projects
 cookbooks
 open-source
community
HARDWARE DESIGN WORK-FLOW
 Parts Selection and Schematic Capture
 Schematic Review – REVISIT QUESTIONS
 Layout Floor-planning (mechanical)
 PCB Layout
 Schematic + Layout Review – REVISIT QUESTIONS
 Pre-Tapeout Verification
 Manufacturing Tape-out
 Test and Characterization
 Iterate (if necessary)
 Document
 Release
BEST PRACTICES: SCH/BOM
 as you select parts for your schematic, curate
your CAD library and update your Bill of
Materials as you go. This helps you to avoid
footprint and pinout mistakes
 for every part on your BOM, take the extra
time to find multiple vendors and list both the
FUNCTION of the part and its CRITICAL
SPECIFICATION (tolerance, size, cheapness,
etc).
 for each part make a note of any physical
Design Rules for the PCB layout.
BEST PRACTICES: PCB/PROTOTYPE
 Take your Design Rules and follow them to the
best of your ability.
 Verify against Schematic.
 Review with others. REVISIT QUESTIONS.
 Built. Test.
 Iterate until satisfied.
PRE-TAPEOUT CHECKLIST
 Have you fixed all DRC/ERC errors?
 All part footprints on PCB match BOM?
 All part pin-outs on schematic match data sheet?
 Does your schematic match your working proto?
 Did you verify the critical spec for each part?
 Did you find the right vendor part number for
each part?
 Is your part in stock? (BUY IT NOW)
 All Pin-1 designators correct?
 All RefDes labels correct?
FABRICATION PACKAGE CHECKLIST
 GERBERS
 NC Drill File
 Assembly Drawing
 Pick & Place Coordinates
 BOM
 Part ID
 Reference Designator(s)
 Part Type
 Package Footprint
 Value/Description/Critical Spec
 Manufacturer’s Part Number
 Vendor’s Part Number
SO, NOW YOUR DESIGN DOCUMENTATION IS JUST
COMPILING WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW
 Project Introduction (Goals, Overview)
 System Block Diagram
 Discussion of Essential Features/Trade-offs
 Block-by-Block Breakdown
 Function
 Schematic block
 Layout block
 Parts selection (and critical specs)
 Performance metrics (if applicable)
 Software/Firmware Summary
 Typical Application
 User’s Quick-Start Guide
 Errata
WHY BOTHER WITH ALL OF THAT PROCESS
AND DETAIL FOR A DEMO?
WHEN YOU FOLLOW A PROCESS, YOU GAIN
EFFICIENCY. WHEN WE NEEDED TO PROTOTYPE A
DIAGNOSTIC MICROSCOPE, I HAD ALL THE PARTS.
HOBBY PROJECT OR INDUSTRY PRODUCT, THE GIST
OF THE PROCESS REMAINS THE SAME – ONLY THE
DETAILS CHANGE
 README.txt
 Schematic
 Gerber
 BOM
 Design History File
 Hazard Analysis
 Failure Mode Effects
Analysis
 Risk Mitigation
 Statistical
Performance
 Margins/Tolerance
 Lifetime Reliability
 SOPs
 etc… etc… etc…
PROCESS TRANSPARENCY ALLOWS YOU TO
CONQUER:
 ANALYST BIAS – “The previous guy knew what
he was doing better than I do.”
 HUBRIS – “I know best, that other guy is an
idiot.”
 CARGO CULT THINKING – “Engineering must
be magic. If we copy it and it looks the same, it’s
got to work, right?”
THE MORE WE SHARE, THE MORE OTHERS
CAN QUESTION OUR DESIGN… THE FASTER
WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR COLLECTIVE
MISTAKES AND THE SOONER WE CAN
CELEBRATE OUR COLLECTIVE SUCCESSES.
