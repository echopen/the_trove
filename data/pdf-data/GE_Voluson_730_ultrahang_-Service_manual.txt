Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
1-4-1 What is EMC?
Electromagnetic compatibility describes a level of performance of a device within its electromagnetic
environment. This environment consists of the device itself and its surroundings including other
equipment, power sources and persons with which the device must interface. Inadequate compatibility
results when a susceptible device fails to perform as intended due interference from its environment or
when the device produces unacceptable levels of emission to its environment. This interference is often
referred to as radio–frequency or electromagnetic interference (RFI/EMI) and can be radiated through
space or conducted over interconnecting power of signal cables. In addition to electromagnetic energy,
EMC also includes possible effects from electrical fields, magnetic fields, electrostatic discharge and
disturbances in the electrical power supply.
For applicable standards refer to Chapter 2 in the Basic User Manual of the Voluson® 730Expert.

2-2-3 EMI Limitations
Ultrasound machines are susceptible to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) from radio frequencies,
magnetic fields, and transients in the air or wiring. Ultrasound machines also generate EMI. The
Voluson® 730Expert complies with limits as stated on the EMC label. However, there is no guarantee
that interference will not occur in a particular installation.
Electrical and electronic equipment may produce EMI unintentionally as the result of a defect.
Sources of EMI include the following:
• medical lasers
• scanners
• cauterizing guns
• computers
• monitors
• fans
• gel warmers
• microwave oven
• light dimmers
• portable phones
• broadcast stations and mobile broadcasting machines
NOTICE
!! NOTICE:
Possible EMI sources should be identified before the unit is installed.
Table 2-4 EMI Prevention/Abatement
EMI Rule Details
Be aware of RF sources.
Keep the unit at least 5 meters (16.4 feet) away from other EMI sources. Special shielding may be
required to eliminate interference problems caused by high frequency, high powered radio or video
broadcast signals.
Ground the unit.
Poor grounding is the most likely reason a unit will have noisy images.
Check grounding of the power cord and power outlet.
Replace and/or reassemble
all screws, RF gaskets,
covers and cores.
After you finish repairing or updating the system, replace all covers and tighten all screws.
Any cable with an external connection requires a magnet wrap at each end.
Install the shield over the front of card cage. Loose or missing covers or RF gaskets allow radio
frequencies to interfere with the ultrasound signals.
Replace broken RF gaskets.
If more than 20% or a pair of the fingers on an RF gasket are broken, replace the gasket.
Do not turn ON the unit until any loose metallic part is removed and replaced, if required.
Do not place labels where
RF gaskets touch metal.
Never place a label where RF gaskets meet the unit. Otherwise, the gap created will permit RF
leakage. In case a label has been found in such a location, move the label to a different,
appropriate location.
Use GE- specified
harnesses and peripherals.
The interconnect cables are grounded and require ferrite beads and other shielding.
Cable length, material, and routing are all important; do not make any changes that do not meet
all specifications.
Take care with cellular
phones.
Cellular phones may transmit a 5 V/m signal that causes image artifacts.
Properly dress peripheral
cables.
Do not allow cables to lie across the top of the card cage or hang out of the peripheral bays.
Loop the excess length for peripheral cables inside the peripheral bays.
Attach the monitor cables to the frame.

Rotate the 2D MODE key to adjust the sensitivity (brightness) of the entire
image.
2
Transmit Power
Optimizes image quality and allows user to reduce beam intensity.
3
Focus Depth
To select the depth position of the actual focus zone(s). Arrows at the left
edge of the 2D-Image mark the active focal zone(s) by their depth position.
4
Depth
Adjusts the depth range of the ultrasound image for the region of interest.

6 FFC (Focus and Frequency Composite)
FFC combines a low frequency to increase the penetration and higher
frequency to keep a high resolution.
It reduces speckle and artifacts in the 2D image.
7 XBEAM CRI (CrossBeam
Compound Resolution Imaging)
Pulses are transmitted not only perpendicularly to the acoustic window, but
also in oblique directions. The advantages of XBeam CRI are enhanced
contrast resolution with better tissue differentiation and clear organ borders.
8 CE (Coded Excitation)
Coded Excitation improves image resolution and penetration in the far field.
This allows to use a higher frequency on technically difficult patients.
9 SRI (Speckle Reduction Imaging)
Speckle Reduction Imaging is a smoothing type filter to reduce speckle in the
ultrasound image.

image with SRI and XBEAM CRI information.
12 LINEAR / TRAPEZ
Advantage of the Trapezoid Mode: The scan area is very increased in
relation to the linear display by steering the ultrasound lines in the border of
the probe.
13 Image Orientation
Use the LEFT/RIGHT respectively the UP/DOWN keys on the Touch Panel
to alternate the image orientation.
14 ANGLE
Use this control to select a part of interest of the 2D image. The advantage
of the decreased field-of-view is an increased 2D frame rate due to the
smaller sector width.
15 ß-VIEW
This function allows the adjustment of the Volume O-Axis position of 3D
probes in 2D Mode. The green line in the displayed symbol indicates the
position of the acoustic block.
16 ZOOM Image magnification (Pan Zoom) in read-/ and write mode.
17 FOC. ZONES
Increases the number of transmit focal zone, so that you can tighten up the
beam for a specific area.
18 OTI (Otimized Tissue Imaging) OTI™ allows to “fine tune” the system for scanning different kinds of tissue.
19 FREQUENCY
To adjust the range of the receive frequency.
high resolution / lower penetration, mid resolution / mid penetration, or
lower resolution / high penetration
20 GRAY CHROMA MAP
A gray map determines the displayed Brightness of an echo in relationship
to its amplitude.
21 PERSIST.
Persistence is a temporal filter that averages frames together.
This has the effect of presenting a smoother, softer image.
This function is only available if XBEAM CRI is switched off.
22 CRI FILTER
If this filter is set to “high”, the XBeam CRI-image is smoothed.
CRI Filter setting “off” leads to a sharper impression of the XBeam CRI-
image. This function is only available if XBEAM CRI is switched on.
23 LINE FILTER
The signals of the neighboring pulses are less weighted for the display of the
actual pulse which considerably improves the detail lateral resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio.
This function is only available if XBEAM CRI is switched off.
24 DYN.CONTR.
Dynamic Range controls how echo intensities are converted to shades of
gray, thereby increasing the adjustable range of contrast.
25 ENHANCE
Edge Enhance brings out subtle tissue differences and boundaries by
enhancing the gray scale differences corresponding to the edges of
structures.
26 REJECT
Selects a level below which echoes will not be amplified (an echo must have
a certain minimum amplitude before it will be processed).
27 QUALITY
Control to improve the resolution by reducing the frame rate.
Respectively reducing the resolution by increasing the image frame rate.

Table 4-7 Pre-Volume Mode Functions
Step Task Expected Results
1 AQUISITION:
• 3D STATIC 3D Volume Mode - Static volume acquisition (also in combination with PD or CFM Mode)
• 4D REAL TIME Real Time 4D - continuous volume acquisition and parallel calculation of 3D rendered images
• VCI A-PLANE
Volume Contrast Imaging - improves the contrast resolution and the signal / noise ratio and
therefore facilitates finding of diffuse lesions in organs
• VCI C-PLANE
Volume Contrast Imaging (coronal plane) - improves the contrast resolution and the signal / noise
ratio and therefore facilitates finding of diffuse lesions in organs
• STIC The fetal heart or an artery can be visualized in 4D (also in combination with PD, HD-Flow or CFM)
• 4D BIOPSY Real Time 4D Biopsy - continuous volume acquisition + parallel calculation of 3D rendered images
2 VISUALIZATION:
• VOCAL
The basic idea behind VOCAL II is the combination of 3D ultrasound tissue (presented as voxels)
and the geometric information of surfaces in a 3D dataset. After definition of contour in 3D space
(semi-automatically, manually or spherical) a wide range of functionality is given.
• NICHE
Parts of the orthogonal sections A, B and C are compiled to a 3D-section aspect. The name
“Niche” has been chosen because the aspect shows a quasi spatial cut into the reference image.
• RENDER
After the 3D acquisition the system switches automatically to the read menu. The selected format
will be present on the monitor (e.g., 3D ROI Mode: sectional planes A,B,C + rendered 3D image).
• SECTIONAL PL.
After the 3D Sectional Planes acquisition the system switches automatically to the read menu.
The selected format will be present on the monitor (e.g., A,B,C - Sectional Plane mode).
• TUI
This method of visualization is consistent with the way other medical systems such CT or MRI
present the data to the user (slices through the data set, which are parallel to each other).
• VCI STATIC
The data set is represented such as in Static 3D - Sectional Planes. However, the three planes
are VCI renderings (tissue information of a thick slice), computed from the 3D dataset.
• VCAD HEART
BT Version:
BT-Version:
VCAD is a technology that automatically generates a number of views of the fetal heart to make
diagnosis easier. It can help to find the right and left outflow tract of the heart and fetal stomach.
This feature is only available at Voluson® 730Expert systems with BT08 software (SW5.4.x).

When the Full Backup is stored on a network drive (to map a network drive see: Section 3-11-1 "Map
Network Drive" on page 3-54), it may be desirable to move the data (e.g., for backup or maintenance).
The backups reside in sub folders of the main “fullbackup” -folder found at the root of the drive.
For Example: Backups on the mapped Network Drive are below path Z:\fullbackup.
The directory structure of the full backup data is as follows:

When the backup is saved to an external USB-device, the system has to be informed about the removal
of the hardware. For this purpose every last dialog of "Full Backup Save" and "Full Backup Delete" has
a STOP USB DEVICES button (see: Figure 4-32).
Figure 4-32 Please stop USB Devices before unplugging!
The sub folders have the names fbX where X is a number
(e.g., Z:\fullbackup\fb1).
The data resides within a directory structure within these sub folders.
It is possible to move the fbX sub folders, even leaving gaps in the
numeration sequence.
However, NO change MUST be made to the contents of the fbX folders
itself, otherwise the backup data cannot be restored!
If the destination „Other drive“ is selected, the available drives
(e.g., external USB-memory stick) can be chosen from the drop down menu.

5-2-1 Description of Voluson® 730Expert Operating Modes
5-2-1-1 B-Mode or 2D-Mode
B-Mode or 2D-mode is a two-dimensional image of the amplitude of the echo signal. It is used for
location and measurement of anatomical structures and for spatial orientation during operation of other
modes. In 2D-mode, a two-dimensional cross-section of a three-dimensional soft tissue structure such
as the heart is displayed in real time. Ultrasound echoes of different intensities are mapped to different
gray scale or color values in the display. The outline of the 2D cross-section may be a rectangle,
parallelogram, sector or 360-degree circle, depending on the particular transducer used.
2D-mode can be used in combination with any other mode.
5-2-1-1-1 Coded Harmonic Imaging (HI)
In Harmonic Imaging, acoustic aberrations due to tissue are minimized by receiving and processing
the second harmonic signal that is generated within the insonified tissue. Voluson® 730Expert´s
high performance HI provides superb detail resolution and penetration, outstanding contrast
resolution, excellent acoustic clutter rejection and an easy to operate user interface.
Coded Harmonics enhances near field resolution for improved small parts imaging as well as far
field penetration. It diminishes low frequency amplitude noise and improves imaging technically
difficult patients. It may be especially beneficial when imaging isoechoic lesions in shallow-depth
anatomy in the breast, liver and hard-to-visualize fetal anatomy.
Coded Harmonics may improve the B-Mode image quality without introducing a contrast agent.

5-2-1-2 M-Mode
In M-mode, soft tissue structure is presented as scrolling display, with depth on the Y-axis and time on
the X-axis. It is used primarily for cardiac measurements such as value timing on septal wall thickness
when accurate timing information is required. M-mode is also known as T-M mode or time-motion mode.
Ultrasound echoes of different intensities are mapped to different gray scale values in the display.
M-mode displays time motion information of the ultrasound data derived from a stationary beam.
Depth is arranged along the vertical axis with time along the horizontal axis. M-mode is normally used
in conjunction with a 2D image for spatial reference. The 2D image has a graphical line (M-line)
superimposed on the 2D image indicating where the M-mode beam is located.
5-2-1-2-1 MCFM Mode (M Mode + Color Flow Mode)
Color Flow Mode and Color M Mode are Doppler modes intended to add color-coded qualitative
information concerning the relative velocity and direction of fluid motion within the 2D mode or M
mode image. Color Flow overlays color on the M mode trace using velocity and variance color
maps. The Color Flow wedge overlays the 2D mode image and M mode timeline.

5-2-1-3 Color Doppler Modes
Color Doppler is used to detect motion presented as a two-dimensional display.
There are three applications of this technique:
• Color Flow Mode (C) - used to visualize blood flow velocity and direction
• Power Doppler (PD) - used to visualize the spatial distribution of blood
• Tissue Doppler (TD) - used to visualize tissue motion direction and velocity
• Bi-Directional Angio (HD-Flow) - used to visualize flow direction with spatial resolution and low
artifact visibility
5-2-1-3-1 Color Flow Mode
A real-time two-dimensional cross-section image of blood flow is displayed. The 2D cross-section is
presented as a full color display, with various colors being used to represent blood flow (velocity,
variance, power and/or direction). Often, to provide spatial orientation, the full color blood flow cross-
section is overlaid on top of the grayscale cross-section of soft tissue structure (2D echo). For each pixel
in the overlay, the decision of whether to display color (Doppler), gray scale (echo) information or a
blended combination is based on the relative strength of return echoes from the soft tissue structures
and from the red blood cells. Blood velocity is the primary parameter used to determine the display
colors, but power and variance may also used. A high pass filter (wall filter) is used to remove the
signals from stationary or slowly moving structures. Tissue motion is discriminated from blood flow by
assuming that blood is moving faster than the surrounding tissue, although additional parameters may
also be used to enhance the discrimination. Color flow can be used in combination with 2D and Spectral
Doppler modes as well as with 3D mode.
5-2-1-3-2 Power Doppler
A real-time two dimensional cross-section of blood flow is displayed. The 2D cross-section is presented
as a full color display, with various colors being used to represent the power in blood flow echoes. Often,
to provide spatial orientation, the full color blood flow cross-section is overlaid on top of the gray scale
cross-section of soft tissue structure (2D echo). For each pixel in the overlay, the decision of whether
to display color (Doppler power), gray scale (echo) information or a blended combination is based on
the relative strength of return echoes from the soft-tissue structures and from the red blood cells. A high
pass filter (wall filter) is used to remove the signals from stationary or slowly moving structures.
Tissue motion is discriminated from blood flow by assuming that blood is moving faster than the
surrounding tissue, although additional parameters may also be used to enhance the discrimination.
The power in the remaining signal after wall filtering is then averaged over time (persistence) to present
a steady state image of blood flow distribution. Power Doppler can be used in combination with 2D and
Spectral Doppler modes as well as with 3D mode.
5-2-1-3-3 Tissue Doppler
The Tissue Color Doppler Imaging is used for color encoded evaluation of heart movements.
The TD image provides information about tissue motion direction and velocity.
5-2-1-3-4 Bi-Directional Angio (HD-Flow Mode)
Directional Power Doppler is a Power Doppler mode incorporating the flow direction (much like Color
Doppler) into the displayed image. The focus of the settings for Directional Power Doppler is for high
spatial resolution and low artifact visibility, allowing vessels to be seen with less blooming and finer
detail.

5-2-1-4 Pulsed (PW) Doppler
PW Doppler processing is one of two spectral Doppler modalities, the other being CW Doppler. In
spectral Doppler, blood flow is presented as a scrolling display, with flow velocity on the Y-axis and time
on the X-axis. The presence of spectral broadening indicates turbulent flow, while the absence of
spectral broadening indicates laminar flow. PW Doppler provides real time spectral analysis of pulsed
Doppler signals. This information describes the Doppler shifted signal from the moving reflectors in the
sample volume. PW Doppler can be used alone but is normally used in conjunction with a 2D image
with an M-line and sample volume marker superimposed on the 2-D image indicating the position of the
Doppler sample volume. The sample volume size and location are specified by the operator. Sample
volume can be overlaid by a flow direction cursor which is aligned, by the operator, with the direction of
flow in the vessel, thus determining the Doppler angle. This allows the spectral display to be calibrated
in flow velocity (m/sec.) as well as frequency (Hz). PW Doppler also provides the capability of
performing spectral analysis at a selectable depth and sample volume size. PW Doppler can be used
in combination with 2D and Color Flow modes.

5-2-1-5 3D Imaging
The Voluson® 730Expert Ultrasound System will be used to acquire multiple, sequential 2D images
which can be combined to reconstruct a three dimensional image. These 3D images are useful in
visualizing three-dimensional structures, and in understanding the spatial or temporal relationships
between the images in the 2D sequence. The 3D image is presented using standard visualization
techniques, such as surface or volume rendering.
5-2-1-5-1 3D Data Collection and Reconstruction
2D gray scale images including Color Flow or Power Doppler information may be reconstructed.
The acquisition of volume data sets is performed by sweeping 2D-scans with special transducers
(called 3D-transducers) designed for the 2D-scans and the 3D-sweep.
2D ultrasound imaging modes are used to view two dimensional cross-sections of parts of the body.
For example in 2D gray scale imaging, a 2 dimensional cross-section of a 3-dimensional soft-tissue
structure such as the heart is displayed in real time. Typically, the user of an ultrasound system
manipulates position and orientation of this 2D cross-section in real time during an exam.
By changing the position of the cross-section, a variety of views of the underlying structure are
obtained, and these views can be used to understand a 3-dimensional structure in the body.
To complete survey a 3-dimensional structure in the body, it is necessary to collect 2D images
which span a volume containing the structure. One way is to sweep the imaging cross-section by
translating it in a direction perpendicular to the cross-section. Another method is to rotate the cross
section about a line contained in the cross section. The Voluson® 730Expert uses the automated
so called C-Scan for the motion perpendicular to automated B-scan. Once a representative set of
2D cross-sections are obtained, standard reconstruction techniques can be used to construct other
2D cross-sections, or to view the collection of cross-sections as a 3D images.
5-2-1-5-2 3D Image Presentation
Several techniques can be used to aid the human observer in understanding the resulting 2D image
as a representation of a three-dimensional object. One is to rotate the volume of data, and present
the resulting sequence of 2D projections to the observer. The changing direction of observation
helps the observer to separate the features in the volume according to their distance from the
observer.
5-2-1-5-3 3D Rendering
3D (volume) rendering is a calculation process to visualize certain 3D-structures of a scanned
volume by means of a 2D-image. The gray value for each pixel of the 2D-image is calculated from
voxels along the corresponding projection path (analyzing beam) through the volume. The render
(calculation) algorithm, surface or transparent mode, determines how 3D-structures are visualized.

is converted to the new order:
shot1pix1-shot1pix2-shot1pix3..... - shot2pix1-shot2pix2-shot2pix3.....
After DC-cancelling the signal is mixed with RX-Frequency and brought to LF-Spectrum, where the
LowPassFilter cuts HF. Mixer and Magnitude-Calculator arrange Complex Demodulation, and
Logarithmic Amplifier arrange the conversion from High-Dynamic LinearSignal to the Low-
Dynamik(e.g.8Bit) Log-Signal. Several Postprocessing steps (LineFilter, FrameFilter, ReSample,
Edge Enhance) enable smooth image quality while keeping contrast high.
2.) CPR

The CPD consists of Beamformer-ASIC, TX-Amplifier, RX-TGC-Amplifier, Signal-ADC.
Each CPD can support 8 TX-Channels and 4 RX-Channels.
- TX-Channel: ASIC generates TX-Freq through dividing 60MHz by 2,3,4,5,... and TX-Focus.
- RX-Channel: ASIC generates Sample-Clocks for the ADC, manages RX-Focus (Delay and
Chain-Adder) and Apodization.
3.) CKV - Direct Memory Access (DMA) section
B-mode-Data from CRS is written via Signal Processor (SP) Channel 0 into SDRAM Fifo Buffer
memory. DMA Controller 0 transfers the data into PC main memory where scan conversion is
performed per software.
Cine Mode: Reserved area in PC main memory is used.
4.) CKV - Video section
The result is transferred to VGA memory via AGP bus. DVI (Digital Visual Interface) video output
signal is connected to CKV, where the analog VGA signals for the monitor and standard video
timing outputs are generated.

5-2-3-1-1 Special B-Mode Techniques
a.) HI (Coded Harmonic Imaging):
In one method of HI the RX-Frequency is doubled, so that the radial resolution is increased
due to the higher RX-Frequency.
The second method of HI is pulse-inversion: 2 TX-Beams are shot to the same Tissue-location,
one with positive, one with negative polarity. The subtraction of both shots (Subtraction Filter)
brings to bear the nonlinear-echo-reflection-properties of the tissue (especially in usage of
Contrast-medias), which is very useful with extremely difficult-to-image patients.
b.) FFC (Frequency and Focus Composite):
2 or more TX-Beams are shot to the same Tissue-location. The Beams have different TX-foci.
By means of Blending (adaption of Brightnesses) they are composed to one whole RX-Line.
c.) XBEAM CRI (CrossBeam - Compound Resolution Imaging):
Does not need any special functions of CRS.
Image is composed of more than one different-direction-steered images. PC-calculated.
d.) VCI (Volume Contrast Imaging): Does not need any special functions of CRS.
Image is composed of more than 2 small angle neighbored images. PC-calculated.

5-2-4-1 Real Time 4D
Real Time 4D mode is obtained through continuous volume acquisition and parallel calculation of 3D
rendered images. In Real Time 4D mode the volume acquisition box is at the same time the render box.
All information in the volume box is used for the render process. In Real Time 4D mode a “frame rate”
of up 25 volumes/second is possible. By freezing the acquired volumes, size can be adjusted,
manipulated manually as known from the Voluson 3D Mode.
5-2-4-2 DICOM
Voluson® 730Expert software package providing following DICOM functionality:
• Storage Service Class
• Print Management Service Class
• Modality Worklist Management Service Class
• Structured Reporting Service Class
• Storage Commit Service Class
• Modality Performed Procedure Step Service Class
Sending of reports - Additionally all OB/Gyn measurements can be sent to a PC*.
Receiving of these reports is supported by ViewPoint workstation “PIA” only. All other workstations can
be adapted individually.
* Without using structured reporting.
5-2-4-3 Real Time 4D-Biopsy
For minimal invasive procedures like biopsies, ultrasound is a widely used method to visualize and
guide the needle during puncture. The advantage in comparison with other imaging methods is the real-
time display, quick availability and easy access to any desired region of the patient. The 4D biopsy
allows for real time control of the biopsy needle in 3D multi-planar display during the puncture. The user
is able to see the region of interest in three perpendicular planes (longitudinal, transversal and frontal
section) and can guide the biopsy needle accurately into the centre of the lesion.
5-2-4-4 VOCAL II - Virtual Organ Computer-aided Analysis
Diagnosis and therapy of cancer is one of the most important issues in medical care.
The VOCAL II - Imaging program allows completely new possibilities in cancer diagnosis, therapy
planning and follow-up therapy control.
VOCAL II offers additional functions:
• Manual or Semi automatic Contour detection of structures (such as tumor lesion, cyst, prostate,
etc.) and subsequent volume calculation.
The accuracy of the process can be visually controlled by the examiner in multi-planar display.
• Construction of a virtual shell around the contour of the lesion. The wall thickness of the shell can
be defined. The shell can be imagined as a layer of tissue around the lesion, where the tumor
vascularization takes place.
• Automatic calculation of the vascularization within the shell by 3D color histogram by comparing the
number of color voxels to the number of grayscale voxels.
5-2-4-5 XTD-View (Extended View)
XTD-View provides the ability to construct and view a static 2D image which is wider than the field of
view of a given transducer. This feature allows viewing and measurement of anatomy that is larger than
what would fit in a single image. XTD-View constructs the extended image from individual image frames
as the operator slides the transducer along the surface of the skin in direction of the scan plane.
Examples include scanning of vascular structures and connective tissues in the arms and legs.

5-2-4-6 STIC (Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation)
With this acquisition method the fetal heart or an artery can be visualized in 4D.
It is not a Real Time 4D technique, but a post processed 3D acquisition.
In order to archive a good result, try to adjust the size of the volume box and the sweep angle to be as
small as possible. The longer the acquisition time, the better the spatial resolution will be.
A good STIC, STIC CFM (2D+CFM), STIC PD (2D+PD) or STIC HD (2D+HD-Flow) data set shows a
regular and synchronous pumping of the fetal heart or of an artery.
The user must be sure that there is minimal movement of the participating persons (e.g., mother and
fetus), and that the probe is held absolutely still throughout the acquisition period. Movement will cause
a failure of the acquisition. The acquired images are post processed to calculate a 4D Volume Cine
sequence. Please make sure that the borders of the fetal heart or the artery are smooth and there are
no sudden discontinuities. If the user (trained operator) clearly recognizes a disturbance during the
acquisition period, the acquisition has to be cancelled.
• STIC - Fetal Cardio is only available on RAB & RIC probes in the OB/GYN application.
• STIC - Vascular is only available on the RSP probe in the Peripheral Vascular application.
5-2-4-7 XBeam CRI - CrossBeam Compound Resolution Imaging
In this special B-mode, beams are transmitted not only perpendicularly to the acoustic window, but also
in oblique directions. Between three and nine beams are correlated to form one image line.
The advantages of CrossBeam Compound Resolution Imaging are enhanced contrast resolution with
better tissue differentiation and clear organ borders. Also vessel walls and tissue layers are emphasized
for easier recognition.
5-2-4-8 B-Flow
B-Flow is especially intuitive when viewing blood flow, for acute thrombosis, parenchymal flow and jets.
It helps to visualize complex hemodynamics and highlights moving blood in tissue.
B-Flow is less angle-independent, no velocity aliasing artifacts, displays a full field of view and provides
better resolution when compared with Color-Doppler Mode. It is therefore a more realistic (intuitive)
representation of flow information, allowing to view both high and low velocity flow at the same time.
5-2-4-9 VCI - Volume Contrast Imaging
Volume Contrast Imaging utilizes 4D transducers to automatically scan multiple adjacent slices and
delivers a real-time display of the ROI.
This image results from a special rendering mode consisting of texture and transparency information.
VCI improves the contrast resolution and therefore facilitates finding of diffuse lesions in organs.
VCI has more information (from multiple slices) and is of advantage in gaining contrast due to improved
signal/noise ratio.
Static VCI is a part of the VCI option, which allow to apply the contrast enhancing VCI method to 3D
data sets after the acquisition.

5-2-4-10 Coded Contrast Imaging
Injected contrast agents re-emit incident acoustic energy at a harmonic frequency much more efficiently
than the surrounding tissue. Blood containing the contrast agent stands out brightly against a dark
background of normal tissue.
Possible clinical uses are to detect and characterize tumors of the liver, kidney and pancreas and to
enhance flow signals in the determination of stenosis or thrombus.
5-2-4-11 SRI or SRI II - Speckle Reduction Imaging
A type of image noise or interference is generally considered undesirable and can obscure the quality
or interpretation of B-mode images. Although somewhat associated with the underlying echogenicity of
tissue scatters, image speckle characteristics such as brightness, density or size have no apparent
value in determining tissue structure or related properties. The elimination of or significant reduction in
speckle improves the quality or diagnostic potential of the image.
The method applied in the subject modification utilizes a nonlinear diffusion filtering technique that
permits effective speckle reduction in real time. The speckle reduction filter is available to the user in all
B-mode imaging, independent of the transducer used.
5-2-4-12 T.U.I - Tomographic Ultrasound Imaging
TUI is a new visualisation mode for 3D and 4D data sets. The data is presented as slices through the
data set which are parallel to each other. An overview image, which is orthogonal to the parallel slices,
shows which parts of the volume are displayed in the parallel planes. This method of visualisation is
consistent with the way other medical systems such as CT or MRI, present the data to the user.
The distance between the different planes can be adjusted to the requirements of the given data set.
In addition it is possible to set the number of planes. The planes and the overview image can also be
printed to a DICOM printer, for easier comparison of the ultrasound data with CT and/or MRI data.
5-2-4-13 Inversion
Inversion render mode is used to display anechoic structures such as vessels.
It is a simple gray render mode but inverts the gray values of the rendered image
(e.g., image information that was black becomes white and vice versa).
5-2-4-14 SonoVCAD Heart- Computer Assisted Heart Diagnosis Package
VCAD is a technology that automatically generates a number of views of the fetal heart to make
diagnosis easier. At this time it can help to find the right and left outflow tract of the heart and the fetal

5-2-5-1 CW - Continuous Wave Doppler
CW Doppler mode provides real time spectral analysis of CW Doppler signals. This information
describes the Doppler shifted signal from the moving reflectors in the CW Doppler beam. CW Doppler
can be referenced through a small pencil probe or phased array scan head, but it can also be used in
conjunction with a 2D image which has an M-line superimposed on the 2D image indicating the position
of the Doppler sample volume. For through-the-beamformer CW, this beam is steerable by the operator,
and is done by adjusting the location of the M-line. The CW Doppler beam, or M-mode line, can be
steered allowing interrogation along an operator-selected line within the image.
This option can be upgraded by implementing the CW-Dopplerboard (CRW).

The GEM Module contains the DVD/CD+(R)W Drive.
Additionally the Magneto Optical Drive and the ECG-preamplifier (MAN6) can be installed as an Option.
5-10-1-1 ECG-preamplifier (MAN6 - optional)
The ECG-preamplifier is used for acquiring an ECG-signal to be displayed with the ultrasound image.
This optional peripheral serves for gaining an ECG-signal to mark the systolic and end diastolic
moments in M-Mode and Doppler evaluations.
The ECG-preamplifier must not be used for ECG-diagnostics. It is not intended for use as a cardiac
monitor and must not be used for an intraoperative application on the heart.
5-10-1-2 DVD/CD+(R)W Drive
The DVD/CD+(R)W Drive (Writer) is used to backup images and reports. In addition, it is used as the
main source of software upgrades and other service utility operations. The DVD/CD+(R)W Drive can
read/write CD´s and DVD´s.
5-10-1-3 Magneto-Optical Drive (optional)
Storage capacity by disk: 1.3GB, 640MB, 540MB, 230MB, 128MB
The MO-Drive allows to read and write any GIGAMO standard 1.3GB disk at twice the liner bit density.
Additionally it retains full read/write compatibility with ISO/IEC 3.5 - inch disks ranging from original
128MB to current 640MB.
MO disks are nearly indestructible and immune from the problems that plague magnetic media.
MO disks can be rewritten an unlimited number of times.

Section 5-11
Power Distribution
5-11-1 CPN6 - Primary Power Module
5-11-1-1 Mechanical Concept and Overview
The AC Power’s main tasks are to supply the various internal subsystems with AC power and to
galvanically isolate the scanner from the on site Mains Power System. To reduce inrush current, an
inrush current limiter as well as an EMI filter is implemented.
Voltage to peripherals can be configured to either 115 VAC or 230 VAC.
The mains cord has plugs on both ends.
A female plug connects to the scanner and a male plug to the mains outlet on site.
The mains voltage is routed via an EMI filter to the Mains Switch, located on the rear of the system.
The Mains Switch is of the auto fuse type, if for some reason the current grows to high, the switch will
automatically break the power.
From the Mains Switch, the AC power is routed via an Inrush Current Limiter to a internal outlet
connector for the Mains Transformer.
5-11-1-2 Major Functions of CPN6
• Inrush Current limiter
• Power factor correction transformer for Sinus load for the mains voltage
• Power down Circuitry + Standby-Switch
• The CPN6 module generates 57VDC (+/-2V) as an input voltage for the Secondary Power supply
of the GEF module.
• The CPN6 module contains also the isolation transformer for the peripherals.

5-11-2 CPN80-81 - Primary Power Module
5-11-2-1 Mechanical Concept and Overview
The AC Power’s main tasks are to supply the various internal subsystems with AC power and to
galvanically isolate the scanner from the on site Mains Power System. To reduce inrush current, an
inrush current limiter is implemented.
Voltage to peripherals can be configured to either 115 VAC or 230 VAC.
The mains cord has plugs in both ends. A female plug connects to the scanner and a male plug to the
mains outlet on site.
From the Mains Power Input module, the AC power is routed via an Inrush Current Limiter to a internal
outlet connector for the Mains Transformer.
5-11-2-2 Major Functions of CPN80-81
• Inrush Current limiter
• Power factor correction transformer for Sinus load for the mains voltage
• Power down Circuitry + Standby-Switch
• The CPN module generates 57VDC (+/-2V) as an input voltage for the Secondary Power supply of
the GEF module.
• The CPN80-81 module contains also the isolation transformer for the peripherals.
(Maximum load: 350VA) see: Basic User Manual Chapter 23 Technical Data/Information
NOTE: All DC-supply voltages for built in peripherals are generated in GEF-module not inside CPN80-81.
NOTE: The system mains supply input voltage can be set to: 110V, 130V, 230V, 240V.
The output voltages may be set to 115V or 230VAC (independent from the input voltages).

Adjusting the monitor´s contrast and brightness is one of the most important factors for proper image
quality. If these controls are set incorrectly, the Gain, TGC, Dynamic Range and even Acoustic Output
may have to be changed more often than necessary to compensate.
The proper setup displays a complete gray scale. The lowest level of black should just disappear into
the background and the highest white should be bright, but not saturated.
NOTE: Brightness and Contrast should be adjusted at examination room light conditions.
Typically values for Contrast and Brightness are 70 to 75, depending on the operator!
1.) Press the MENU (middle) key (see: Figure 6-1) on the monitor controls
(= toggle button for contrast and brightness).
2.) Adjust the CONTRAST by pressing the LEFT or RIGHT button to decrease/increase the value.

2.) Raster lines are straight.
3.) No keystone and pincushion distortion.
4.) Horizontal and vertical width is correct.
6-3-1-5 Convergence
Check the color of the raster lines (see: Figure 6-2).
Expected result:
Raster lines have only one color.
6-3-1-6 Color temperature
Check the grey scale and the color bars of the test pattern (see: Figure 6-2).
Expected results:
1.) “White“ is displayed without a tint (discolor).

8-2 Section 8-2 - Ultrasound Application Software (UIS) Installation Procedure
8-1-2 Returning/Shipping Probes and Repair Parts
Equipment being returned must be clean and free of blood and other infectious substances.
GEHC policy states that body fluids must be properly removed from any part or equipment prior to
shipment. GEHC employees, as well as customers, are responsible for ensuring that parts/equipment
have been properly decontaminated prior to shipment. Under no circumstance should a part or
equipment with visible body fluids be taken or shipped from a clinic or site (for example, body coils or
and ultrasound probe).
The purpose of the regulation is to protect employees in the transportation industry, as well as the
people who will receive or open this package.
NOTE: The US Department of Transportation (DOT) has ruled that “items what were saturated and/or dripping
with human blood that are now caked with dried blood; or which were used or intended for use in patient
care” are “regulated medical waste” for transportation purpose and must be transported as a hazardous
material.

Overview
10-1-1 Periodic Maintenance Inspections
It has been determined by engineering that your Voluson® 730Expert system does not have any high
wear components that fail with use, therefore no Periodic Maintenance Inspections are mandatory.
However, some Customers Quality Assurance Programs may require additional tasks and/or
inspections at a different frequency than listed in this manual.
10-1-2 Purpose of Chapter 10
This chapter describes Care & Maintenance on the Voluson® 730Expert system and its peripherals.
These procedures are intended to maintain the quality of the ultrasound systems performance.
Read this chapter completely and familiarize yourself with the procedures before performing a task.

10-2 Section 10-2 - Why do Maintenance
Section 10-2
Why do Maintenance
10-2-1 Keeping Records
It is good business practice that ultrasound facilities maintain records of quality checks and corrective
maintenance. The Ultrasound Inspection Certificate (see: page 10-25) provides the customer with
documentation that the ultrasound scanner is maintained on a periodic basis.
A copy of the Ultrasound Inspection Certificate should be kept in the same room or near the scanner.
10-2-2 Quality Assurance
In order to gain accreditation from organizations such as the American College of Radiology (USA), it
is the customer’s responsibility to have a quality assurance program in place for each scanner.
The program must be directed by a medical physicists, the supervising radiologist/physician or
appropriate designer.
Routine quality control testing must occur regularly. The same tests are performed during each period
so that changes can be monitored over time and effective corrective action can be taken.
Testing results, corrective action and the effects of corrective action must be documented and
maintained on the site.
Your GE service representative can help you with establishing, performing and maintaining records for
a quality assurance program. Please contact us for coverage information and/or price for service.
Section 10-3
Maintenance Task Schedule
10-3-1 How often should care & maintenance tasks be performed?
The Care & Maintenance Task Schedule (see: page 10-3) specifies how often your Voluson®
730Expert should be serviced and outlines items requiring special attention.
NOTE: It is the customer’s responsibility to ensure the Voluson® 730Expert care & maintenance is performed
as scheduled in order to retain its high level of safety, dependability and performance.
Your GE Service Representative has an in-depth knowlegde of your Voluson® 730Expert ultrasound
scanning system and can best provide competent, efficient service.
Please contact us for coverage information and/or price for service.
The service procedures and recommended intervals shown in the Care & Maintenance Task Schedule
assumes that you use your Voluson® 730Expert for an average patient load (10-12 per day) and not
use it as a primary mobile unit which is transported between diagnostic facilities.
NOTE: If conditions exist which exceed typical usage and patient load, then it is recommended to increase the
maintenance frequencies.

10-5-7-4 Disinfection by means of the RIC-Holder
Especially for Real-time 4D endocavity probes (RIC), it is necessary to take extreme care when
transporting the system with the probe attached, or during the disinfection process.
Inadequate handling may lead to dead elements, shocked head mechanics, etc.
The RIC-Holder (especially developed for RIC Real-time 4D endocavity probes) guarantees that the
sensitive probe head does not hit the bottom of the container during the disinfection procedure.
NOTE: Operation instructions are supplied with each RIC-Holder (KTZ225469).
Endocavity Soaking Cup Kit
is available at GE Accessory
(Order Nr. : E8385TA )
To guarantee that the sensitive probe head does not hit the bottom of
the container, place the probe in the RIC Holder during the disinfection
procedure.

When There's Too Much Leakage Current...
10-8-1 Chassis Fails
Check the ground on the power cord and plug for continuity. Ensure the ground is not broken, frayed,
or intermittent. Replace any defective part.
Tighten all grounds. Ensure star washers are under all ground studs.
Inspect wiring for bad crimps, poor connections, or damage.
Test the wall outlet; verify it is grounded and is free of other wiring abnormalities. Notify the user or
owner to correct any deviations. As a work around, check the other outlets to see if they could be used
instead.
NOTE: No outlet tester can detect the condition where the white neutral wire and the green grounding wire are
reversed. If later tests indicate high leakage currents, this should be suspected as a possible cause and
the outlet wiring should be visually inspected.
10-8-2 Probe Fails
• Test the probe in another connector to isolate if the fault lies with the probe or the scanner.
NOTE: Each probe will have some amount of leakage, dependent on its design. Small variations in probe
leakage currents are normal from probe to probe. Other variations will result from differences in line
voltage and test lead placement. The maximum allowable leakage current for body surface contact
probe differs from inter-cavity probe. Be sure to enter the correct probe type in the appropriate
space on the check list.
• Test the probe in another connector to isolate if the fault lies with the probe or the scanner.
If excessive leakage current is slot dependent, inspect the system connector for bent pins, poor
connections, and ground continuity.
If the problem remains with the probe, replace the probe.
10-8-3 Peripheral Fails
Tighten all grounds. Ensure star washers are under all ground studs.
Inspect wiring for bad crimps, poor connections, or damage.
10-8-3-1 Still Fails
If all else fails, begin isolation by removing the probes, external peripherals, then the on board ones,
one at a time while monitoring the leakage current measurement.
10-8-4 New Unit
If the leakage current measurement tests fail on a new unit and if situation can not be corrected, submit
a Safety Failure Report to document the system problem. Remove unit from operation.
10-8-5 ECG Fails
Inspect cables for damage or poor connections.
