Abstract- In this paper we review the genesis of charge
pump circuits, their evolution and improvement in
design and their importance in nonvolatile memory
circuits, low-voltage analog building blocks and other
applications.
I. INTRODUCTION
Charge pumps are circuits that generate a voltage larger
than the supply voltage from which they operate. To see
how this is possible, consider the simple circuit consisting
of a single capacitor and three switches shown in Fig. 1.
Fig. 1. Simple voltage doubler
During clock phase , switches S1 and S3 are closed and
the capacitor is charged to the supply voltage, VDD. Next
switch S2 is closed and the bottom plate of the capacitor
assumes a potential VDD, while the capacitor maintains its
charge of VDDC from the previous phase. This means
that during
(1)
or
(2)
Thus, in the absence of a d.c. load, an output voltage has
been generated that is twice the supply voltage.
In order to accommodate a load at the output, the circuit
would be modified by adding an output capacitance as
shown in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2. Practical voltage doubler
In this case, the ideal output voltage is given by
(3)
If a load RL is present, then a ripple voltage, VR, is gener-
ated at the output. The ripple voltage can be reduced by
making Cout sufficiently large so that VR is negligible
compared to Vout.
Voltage multiplication greater than twice the supply
voltage can be achieved by cascading more than one
capacitor in series. This voltage multiplier technique
seems to have first been proposed by Cockcroft and Wal-
ton [1] and was used to generate steady potentials near
800,000 volts in connection with studying the atomic
structure of matter. The Cockcroft-Walton multiplying
circuit is shown in Fig. 3. Three capacitors, CA, CB and
CC, each of capacity C, are connected in series and capac-
itor CA is connected to the supply voltage VDD. During
phase capacitor C1 is connected to CA and charged to
voltage VDD. When the switches change position during

the next cycle, , capacitor C1 will share its charge with
capacitor CB and both will be charged to VDD/2 if they
have equal capacity. In the next cycle, C2 and CB will be
connected and share a potential of VDD/4 while C1 is once
again charged to VDD. It is thus obvious that if this pro-
cess continues for a few cycles, charge will be transferred
to all the capacitors until a potential of 3VDD is developed
across the output Vout.
The principle is easily capable of extension, and by add-
ing more capacitors, any multiple of the supply voltage,
VDD, may be obtained. However, in practice, the Cock-
croft-Walton multiplier becomes somewhat inefficient if
implemented in monolithic integrated form because of the
relatively large on-chip stray capacitance. In addition, the
output impedance of the multiplier increases rapidly with
the number of multiplying stages.
In order to overcome these limitations, a new voltage
multiplier circuit was devised by Dickson [2] that is suit-
able for integration in monolithic form. It is similar to the
Cockcroft-Walton multiplier except this new configura-
tion achieves more efficient multiplication even in the
presence of stray capacitance and its drive capability is
independent of the number of multiplier stages. Since
many CMOS charge pumps are based on the circuit pro-
posed by Dickson, a thorough analysis of this classic mul-
tiplier is presented next.
II. DICKSON CHARGE PUMP
The Dickson charge pump [2] is shown in Fig. 4. The
circuit consists of two pumping clocks, and , which
are anti-phase and have a voltage amplitude of . The
diodes operate as self-timed switches characterized by a
forward bias voltage, Vd. Stray capacitance, Cs, is
included at each node for completeness.
Fig. 4. Dickson charge pump
The multiplier operates by pumping charge along the
diode chain as the capacitors are successively charged and
discharged during each clock cycle. When clock phase
goes low, diode D1 conducts until the voltage at node 1
becomes Vin-Vd. When is switched to , the voltage
at node 1 now becomes . This causes
diode D2 to conduct until the voltage at node 2 becomes
equal to . When goes low again,
the voltage at node 2 becomes . After
N stages, it is easy to see that the output voltage is
(4)
The stray capacitance, Cs, can be taken into account by
noticing that it reduces the transferred clock voltage, ,
by a factor . Thus, the actual output voltage
becomes
(5)
Until now it has been assumed that no load was connected
to the output of the charge pump. In the presence of such
a load which draws a current, Iout, the output voltage is
reduced by an amount , where is the
operating frequency of the charge pump. The output volt-
age now becomes

From this equation it becomes apparent that voltage mul-

Following Dickson, eq. (6) can be written as

where

and
(10)
Equation (6) leads to an equivalent circuit of the charge
pump as shown in Fig. 5.
Fig. 5. Equivalent circuit of Dickson charge pump
It should be noted that there will be a small ripple voltage,
VR, at the output due to the load resistance, RL. This rip-
ple voltage is given by
(11)
The ripple voltage can be substantially reduced by
increasing the frequency of the clocks or using a large
output capacitance. In the latter case, it would take the
charge pump significantly longer to reach steady state.
A practical circuit implementation of the Dickson
charge pump in CMOS technology is shown in Fig. 6.
The multiplier chain is implemented using diode-con-
nected NMOS transistors. Here the diode forward volt-
age, Vd, is replaced by the MOS threshold voltage, Vtn,

where in this particular case N=4. We now define a useful
quantity called the voltage fluctuation at each pumping
node, . This is the voltage change that occurs at each
node of a charge pump from one clock cycle to the next.
This is illustrated for the four-stage Dickson charge pump
in Fig. 7.

For the Dickson charge pump, the voltage fluctuation can
be expressed as

We may also define the voltage pumping gain, GV, of a
charge pump as

Unfortunately, as the supply voltage decreases,
decreases and according to eq. (13) so does . Conse-
quently, the pumping gain (eq. (15)) is also reduced. It is
thus obvious that the Dickson charge pump is not at all
suitable for low-voltage operation. If the threshold volt-
age term, , could somehow be eliminated from eq.
(15), the Dickson charge pump would be usable at low-
voltages, offer a better voltage pumping gain and a higher
output voltage. This can be accomplished by modifying
the Dickson charge pump so that it utilizes static charge
transfer switches (CTS’s). The details are presented next.
III. STATIC CTS CHARGE PUMPS
Static CTS charge pumps are new charge pumps employ-
ing dynamic switches to increase the voltage pumping
gain. The basic idea behind these multipliers is to use
MOS switches with precise on/off characteristics to direct
charge flow during pumping rather than using diodes, or
diode connected transistors which inevitably introduce a
forward voltage drop at each node. One of the first low-
voltage CTS based charge pumps with static backward
control was presented in Wu [3]. The circuit details of
this new charge pump (NCP-1) are shown in Fig. 8.
Fig. 8. A four-stage CTS based charge pump
Neglecting for the moment the CTS transistors MS1-MS5,
the operation of this new charge pump is identical to the
operation of the Dickson charge pump and the same ini-
tial voltages will be established at each pumping node.
The idea behind the CTS switches is to use the already
established high voltages at the various nodes to control
the CTS of the previous stage. This will work if the
switches can be turned on / off at the designated times
such that they allow charge to be transferred in only one
direction. When this is the case for each pumping stage,
the input upper voltage of each node is equal to the output
lower voltage as can be seen in Fig. 9.
Fig. 9. CTS based charge pump voltage fluctuation
The voltage pumping gain of this charge pump now
becomes
(17)
Compared with the Dickson charge pump, eq. (15), the
NCP-1 proposed by Wu has a much better charge pump-
ing performance since the term has been eliminated
from eq. (17).
When clock phase is high in Fig. 8, the voltages at
nodes 1 and 2 are equal, while the voltage at node 3 is
above those at nodes 1 and 2. This means that the
gate-to-source voltage of MS2 is . In order for this
transistor to be on, we require
(18)
Comparing this with eq. (16) we see that the NCP-1
charge pump presented by Wu is much more suitable for
low-voltage operation than the Dickson charge pump.
Unfortunately, there is one minor problem with this cir-
cuit configuration, namely, charge leakage in the reverse
direction. When clock phase is low, the voltage at
nodes 2 and 3 is equal and above the voltage at
node 1. Thus, the gate-to-source voltage of MS2 is .
During this clock phase, we ideally require MS2 to be
turned off. This will only be the case if
(19)
Since eq. (18) is always satisfied, it is impossible for the
requirement of eq. (19) to be met. Therefore, switch MS2
will not be completely turned off and reverse charge shar-

ing will occur between node 2 and node 1.
This reverse charge leakage phenomenon can be elimi-
nated by adding pass transistors (both NMOS and PMOS)
to the NCP-1 circuit. The function of these transistors is
to apply dynamic control to the CTS’s in order to turn
them off completely when required and still be able to
turn them on easily by the backward control voltage as in
the NCP-1 case. The details of this so called NCP-2
charge pump are presented in [3]. It can be shown that the
necessary conditions for the NCP-2 charge pump to oper-
ate properly are
(20)
and
(21)
Unlike the NCP-1, these conditions can be satisfied simul-
taneously and the resulting charge pump offers excellent
performance.
IV. ADVANCED CHARGE PUMP TECHNIQUES
Another class of charge pump designs suitable for high-
performance, low-voltage operation are those based on
switched-capacitor techniques [4]. A high efficiency
CMOS voltage doubler with good accuracy is presented
in [5]. This design is simple and power efficient, and with
a few modifications represents the current, state of the art
in charge pump design.
Fig. 10. Modern voltage doubler
A novel, state of the art, high efficiency voltage doubler
suitable for low-voltage / low-power applications has
been developed by Phang [6] and is presented in Fig. 10.
In order to understand the operation of this multiplier, it is
helpful to consider the basic charge pump cell [7] shown
in Fig. 11.
Fig. 11. Basic charge pump cell
The cell uses two non-overlapping, antiphase clocks of
amplitude VDD. Transistors M1 and M2 are successively
switched on and off in order to charge capacitors C1 and
C2 to the voltage Vin. After a few clock cycles, the clock
signals on the top plates of the capacitors will assume an
amplitude of . The switches SW1 and SW2 are
timed so that Vout only sees this voltage. If
then
(22)
and the output is double the supply voltage.
Referring to Fig. 10, we see that the voltage multiplier
consists of three closely-coupled charge pump cells. The
middle cell comprised of M1 and M2 is used to generate a
level-shifted clock signal as described in Fig. 11. This
level-shifted clock signal is used to turn on the outermost
charge pump consisting of devices M3 and M4 and pass
the input voltage, Vin, to the top plates of capacitors C3
and C4. The clock signals driving capacitors C3 and C4,
namely and have a reduced voltage swing
that is equal to the input voltage, Vin. Thus, after a few
clock cycles, the voltage at the top plates of C3 and C4
fluctuates between and . The last charge pump
uses devices M5 and M6 to drive the PMOS output

switches M7 and M8. It is worth noticing that the design
includes a desirable innovation, namely, the low level
clock swing has been shifted to VSWL which has been
optimized for driving the PMOS output switches. This
improves the output resistance of the switches. The full-
swing clock signals and were generated from an
integrated, non-overlapping, two phase clock generator
[8] that is shown in Fig. 12.
Fig. 12. Non-overlapping clock generator
The performance of Phang’s voltage multiplier circuit
was simulated and shown in Fig. 13. The simulation used
an input voltage of 1.5V and a small output load capaci-
tance of 1.0 pF to speed up the transient response. The
circuit exhibited hardly any undershoot and reached
steady state quickly due to the reduced switch resistance
afforded by the dedicated charge pump driving the output
switches.

V. APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
The most obvious application of charge pump circuits is
in the programming of EPROM circuits. Until recently,
most EPROMs used hot-electron injection [9] to program
these devices and required off-chip supply voltages. This
method of programming required large drain currents dur-
ing device flashing and required a dedicated, non-standard
power supply. An alternative method of programming
EPROMs is based on tunneling by Fowler-Nordheim field
emission. For programming, a large voltage (around 10-
15V) is applied to the control gate of the device and
charge is transferred to the floating gate. The advantage
with using this method lies in the fact that no drain current
is required for programming. Hence, on-chip charge
pumps can be used to generate the higher than normal
voltages required to write or erase information in nonvola-
tile memory circuits [10].
Recently, charge pumps and voltage multipliers have
been applied to low-voltage / low-power analog integrated
circuits with some success. A technique known as
‘Dynamic Gate Biasing’ has been pioneered by Phang[7]
and others in a diverse range of applications. In Dynamic
Gate Biasing (DGB), controllable charge pump circuits
are used for the stable biasing of MOSFET gates. These
transistors are biased in the triode region and act as vari-
able resistors. On-chip DGB has shown to be feasible in
the design of a low-voltage, CMOS front-end optical pre-
amplifier[6] and in low-voltage, continuous-time, biqua-
dratic filter applications [11][12].
In the future, as analog designers look for new ways to
meet the challenge of reduced supply voltages, on-chip
charge pumps and voltage multipliers are destined to
become an integral part of low-voltage analog and digital
circuit designs.
