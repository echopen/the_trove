milestones
 1877 Rayleigh laid foundation for modern acoustics (the theory of sound).
 1880 Pierre & Jacques Curie discovered the piezoelectric effect.
 1915 Paul Langevin has demostrated echo-sounding device using quartz crystals.
 1947 Hyperphonography presented by Dussik.
 1954 Jaffe discovered PZT ceramics which has paved the way for modern ultrasound
devices.
 1963 Physionics Engineering commercialised B-mode scanner.
 70s Electronic scanning using linear arrays.
 90s silicon-based MEMS enabling electrostatic membranes for ultrasonic applications.
 Today: MEMS technology open doors to highly integrated transducers for new imaging
modalities and performance.

Transducer types
 Linear Array
• Transducer shape determines display image shape
(rectangular)
 Phased Array
• Dynamic focusing and steering of beam
• Sector display format
 Two-dimensional Array
• Allows for full volume imaging
• Hardware complexity and cost (increased by N²)
 Annular Array
• Cylindrical focusing
• No beam steering

Integration routes with MEMS devices
 Monolithic integration:
• Co-processing (e.g. Eccardt et al.
• Post-processing (e.g. Noble et al.)
 Multi-chip integration (hybrid):
• Chip-to-chip bonding (e.g. Wygant et al.)
 Bonding on a flexible intermediate substrate or interposer
 Bonding on a rigid interposer

What is needed to success?
 Knowledge of:
• Applications often drive technologies (bottom up process)
• Customized MEMs require important investment (modeling &
design)
 Actions to do:
• Effective benchmarking (better, faster, cheaper…)
• Mastering the complete value chain (MEMs foundry partnership,
cooperation with system manufacturers is required)
• Plan your unexpected events or difficulties (process qualification)
 Beware of:
• Peripheric costs (packaging, integration)
• Long development cycles.
• IPR
