Abstract objectives To review the scientific literature pertaining to the use of hand-carried and hand-held
ultrasound devices in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), with a focus on clinical
applications, geographical areas of use, the impact on patient management and technical features of
the devices used.
methods The electronic databases PubMed and Google Scholar were searched. No language or date
restrictions were applied. Case reports and original research describing the use of hand-carried
ultrasound devices in LMIC were included if agreed upon as relevant by two-reviewer consensus
based on our predefined research questions.
results A total of 644 articles were found and screened, and 36 manuscripts were included for final
review. Twenty-seven studies were original research articles, and nine were case reports. Several
reports describe the successful diagnosis and management of difficult, often life-threatening
conditions, using hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound. These portable ultrasound devices have also
been studied for cardiac screening exams, as well as a rapid triage tool in rural areas and after
natural disaster. Most applications focus on obstetrical and abdominal complaints. Portable
ultrasound may have an impact on clinical management in up to 70% of all cases. However, no
randomised controlled trials have evaluated the impact of ultrasound-guided diagnosis and treatment
in resource-constrained settings. The exclusion of articles published in journals not listed in the large
databases may have biased our results. Our findings are limited by the lack of higher quality evidence
(e.g. controlled trials).
conclusions Hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound is successfully being used to triage, diagnose
and treat patients with a variety of complaints in LMIC. However, the quality of the current evidence
is low. There is an urgent need to perform larger clinical trials assessing the impact of hand-carried
ultrasound in LMIC.

Introduction
Ultrasound is a widely used clinical imaging modality for
rapid diagnosis and treatment at the bedside, does not
require any additional personnel and is relatively easy to
learn [1]. It does not expose patients or medical person-
nel to ionising radiation and can be portable and
operated with rechargeable batteries. It is for these rea-
sons that there has been significant interest in employing
this technology in low- and middle-income countries
(LMIC), as it requires less infrastructure and training
than other imaging systems such as computed tomogra-
phy or magnetic resonance imaging. In a 1985 landmark
report on the future use of imaging technologies in

developing countries, WHO concluded that there are
‘very real advantages to be gained from the use’ of ultra-
sound, and noted its potential for ‘improved patient man-
agement and care of the individual’ [2].
In the 1990s, the first portable ultrasound machine –
it could be carried in a backpack – was developed [3].
Since the turn of the millennium, reports on ultrasound
use and training in LMIC have increased exponentially.
However, widespread adoption is still limited by the
cost of most ultrasound machines, limited distribution
and support networks, as well as lack of access to
replacement parts [4]. Other significant barriers that
may further preclude the use in mobile clinics or periph-
eral healthcare centres are only intermittent power sup-
ply to recharge batteries, or unsafe storage. In the last
few years, however, a new generation of hand-carried
and even hand-held ultrasound devices has emerged.
The key difference is that hand-held ultrasound systems
can be used while holding the display unit and probe
using either one or two hands, while hand-carried sys-
tems are typically larger, requiring a surface on which
to place the ultrasound unit prior to performing the
scan. Both hand-carried and hand-held devices are char-
acterised by low cost, a more rugged mechanical design
that withstands rough environments, and use of afford-
able batteries that can be replaced easily. It follows that
these new ultrasound devices can be carried around
with ease by a clinician and may be handed over at the
end of the work period to the covering colleague, thus
obviating the need for safe storage. They can be inte-
grated into the physical examination and initial assess-
ment of a patient, much like a stethoscope, making the
bedside application of ultrasound easier than where a
patient has to be transported to a stationary machine
[5].
Despite the considerable potential of ultrasound-based
imaging to improve the diagnosis of many medical condi-
tions and to guide individual patient management, little
is known about the current practices in LMIC, such as
the extent of use of portable ultrasound devices, major
indications for the use of ultrasound techniques and
impact on patient outcome. We conducted a systematic
review of the literature to elucidate where and how
hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound devices are being
used in LMIC, asking (i) What are the uses and applica-
tions of hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound devices in
LMIC? (ii) In which geographic regions are hand-carried
and hand-held ultrasound devices being used? (iii) What
is the impact of hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound
devices on patient management? (iv) What hand-carried
and hand-held ultrasound devices are available, and what
are their technical specifications?
We critically assess diseases and clinical situations in
which the systematic introduction of clinical ultrasound
examinations at the bedside might be most beneficial,
and also identify drawbacks and research needs.
Methods
We performed a systematic literature review to address
the above-mentioned questions. Two authors (CT, MT)
searched the electronic database PubMed independently
for the search terms shown in Box 1. This was supple-
mented by a manual Google Scholar search and a manual
review of the bibliographies. The manual search was
limited to English language articles. LMIC were defined
based on the World Bank definition of ‘developing
countries’ (available at http://data.worldbank.org/about/
country-and-lending-groups).
For the PubMed search, there were no data range (be-
yond those intrinsic to the PubMed database) and lan-
guage restrictions. The search terms and search strategy
were chosen in consultation with the global health librar-
ian at the University of Michigan. We excluded opinion
articles and commentaries. The last search was completed
on 8 July 2015.
Study selection and data abstraction were performed
independently by two reviewers with clinical experience
pertaining to the use of ultrasound in LMIC (DMB,
TKB) according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement [6]. Any
discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
consensus.
Original research articles and case reports were
included if a manuscript was deemed relevant to any of
the primary research questions addressed by this review
as stated above. Case reports that addressed the primary
research questions were included given the novel charac-
ter of hand-carried (defined as below 4 kg) and hand-held
ultrasound devices. Articles describing the use of such
devices by military units from high-resource countries
within a military hospital in an LMIC but equipped and
operated by the high-resource nation were excluded dur-
ing the screening process.
Raw data were extracted using a standardised template
that included the first author, the year of publication, the
title, the journal and the article was published in, study
design, ultrasound device used, the geographical region
where the study was performed, the environment in
which ultrasound was used and the article’s key findings
(number of study subjects, study subject characteristics,
details regarding interventions and outcome).
A dedicated technology evaluation was completed by
an engineer (GHK), describing the currently available

hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound devices, based on
information from the manufacturer manuals. Data were
extracted and abstracted jointly by the above-mentioned
authors. The review protocol has not been previously
published or registered.
Results
General findings
The initial database search yielded 644 articles. Manual
review of bibliographies generated four additional refer-
ences. All were screened and assessed for eligibility for
full-text review. A total of 591 articles were excluded
after review of the abstracts as they did not report on the
use of hand-carried or hand-held ultrasound as defined
for this review, described non-clinical applications or
reported on studies performed in a non-LMIC context.
The remaining 53 articles were manually reviewed, of
which 36 with relevant content were selected for inclu-
sion (Figure 1). Of these, 27 were original research stud-
ies and nine were case reports (Table 1). Geographically,
most articles were from Africa (13/36), followed by Asia
(10/36) and South America (6/36). The remaining seven
manuscripts came from Haiti (4/36), Turkey (2/36) and
Romania (1/36). Notably, 29/36 articles (80.6%) were
published after 2010.
Indications for application of portable ultrasound
There is considerable variety in the disease spectrum for
which the use of hand-held and hand-carried ultrasound
is reported. However, most indications were in the con-
text of acute medical emergencies and for individual
patient management. Several studies assessed the role and
impact of ultrasound as a screening tool in cardiology
and in natural disasters.
Portable ultrasound for individual patient diagnosis and
management
A case from Sierra Leone highlights the use of a hand-
carried ultrasound device for the diagnosis of a large
empyema, and subsequent management of drains and
complications [7]. A case from Haiti demonstrates the
use of hand-carried ultrasound in the diagnosis and man-
agement of intussusception by a clinician without prior
practical experience in invasive treatment of this condi-
tion [8]. Intussusception was also successfully diagnosed
by a non-physician healthcare worker in Uganda using
hand-carried ultrasound [9]. Goksu et al. describe the
management of a post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm using a
hand-carried ultrasound device [10]. Another case report
from Haiti illustrates the successful use of a hand-carried
device to perform ocular ultrasound to assess a child with

an abnormal eye, ultimately leading to the diagnosis of
retinoblastoma [11]. Foreign body localisation and
removal, a common bedside ultrasound application, was
also successfully performed using hand-carried ultrasound
[12]. Samanta et al. report how bedside ultrasound using
a hand-carried machine was used to guide cardiopul-
monary resuscitation of a patient with situs inversus in
India [13]. Another study from India assessed the feasibil-
ity of cervical ultrasound to detect cervical spine fractures
in children [14]. Hand-carried ultrasound has been suc-
cessfully used for surgical patient selection across a broad
spectrum of diseases, such as abdominal tumours and
congenital malformations, as well as for telemedicine-
guided diagnosis in rural areas [15–17].
Echocardiography using portable ultrasound devices in
LMIC
The role of screening echocardiograms using a hand-car-
ried ultrasound device has been studied in several coun-
tries. Kobal et al. report that they were able to screen or
diagnose patients in rural Mexico referred for a cardiol-
ogy evaluation with a hand-carried ultrasound device,
obviating the need for a comprehensive echocardiogram

D. M. Becker et al. Ultrasound in resource-limited settings
in 90% of patients seen [18]. A similar approach was
used to diagnose patients with left ventricular hypertro-
phy (LVH) [19]. The presence of LVH was used as an
indicator to initiate antihypertensive therapy. Multiple
studies demonstrate the successful use of hand-held ultra-
sound to screen for rheumatic heart disease, where it
appears to be clearly superior to auscultation alone
[20–23]. Echocardiograms performed using a hand-held
ultrasound device in emergency department patients with
suspected cardiac complaints in Brazil helped to confirm
or change the diagnosis in half of all cases, mostly ruling
out heart failure and cardiogenic shock, but also diagnos-
ing pericarditis as cause of chest pain [24]. Two studies
from Brazil demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy of
hand-carried ultrasound compared to comprehensive
echocardiograms when assessing ejection fraction, wall
motion, and valvular regurgitation in cardiac in-patients,
and acquisition of diagnostic skills was reported to be
good even with limited training [25, 26]. Similarly,
researchers from Romania report that cardiology trainees
using a hand-held ultrasound device accurately identified
valvular abnormalities, pericardial effusion and abnormal
left ventricular chamber morphology [27]. Parashar et al.
describe their experiences with a hand-held ultrasound
device in diagnosing a wide variety of cardiac problems,
in particular valvular abnormalities and ischaemia-related
regional wall motion abnormalities [28].
Ultrasound protocols used in LMIC and impact of
portable ultrasound on patient management
Besides echocardiography, only few publications have
assessed the application of ultrasound-based clinical algo-
rithms and protocols for disease processes commonly
encountered in LMIC. Zha et al. developed a risk stratifi-
cation protocol for malaria in an endemic area, using
measurements of spleen, liver and optic nerve sheath
diameter by a hand-held ultrasound device [29]. Murphy
et al. describe a similar protocol, using optic nerve sheath
diameter, echocardiogram, spleen size and transcranial
Doppler measurements [30]. Mand et al. propose the use
of scrotal ultrasound to help in the assessment of lym-
phatic filariasis [31]. Cox et al. developed a protocol
using hand-held ultrasound to guide needle biopsy autop-
sies, which had superior success rates to landmark-guided
needle biopsy [32]. Michels et al. used a hand-held ultra-
sound device for daily serial exams of patients with den-
gue, evaluating them for evidence of subclinical plasma
leakage by screening for pleural effusion, ascites and gall-
bladder wall thickening. They found these sonographic
abnormalities to be more helpful in predicting progres-
sion to severe dengue than using laboratory markers such
as haematocrit. Gallbladder wall thickening was particu-
larly helpful, yielding a negative predictive value for sev-
ere dengue of 91% [33]. Hand-carried ultrasound was
successfully used to confirm the position of an endotra-
cheal tube in neonates in a rural hospital India, with the
potential to obviate the need for radiographic confirma-
tion [34]. A study from Thailand reports on the use of
hand-carried ultrasound to assess laryngeal oedema in
patients being evaluated for extubation readiness [35].
Blavais et al. report on the use of a hand-carried ultra-
sound machine in the Amazon jungle [36]. They found
that ultrasound use had a significant impact on patient
disposition, aiding both in determining the need for rapid
evacuation as well as providing reassurance that local
treatment would be safe. Most scans involved abdominal
and pelvic applications. A hand-held ultrasound device
was used for Focused Assessment with Sonography for
Trauma (FAST) examinations in Turkey, and compared
well to follow-up examinations carried out by radiolo-
gists using full-size machines [37].
Portable ultrasound use in disaster situations
Natural disasters, like earthquakes, are particularly chal-
lenging to manage in LMIC with limited healthcare
resources at baseline. The lack of reliable access to
power, a high number of victims and the need for rapid
triage make ultrasound a frequently used tool in these
scenarios. In all studies identified, patients were evaluated
by modified FAST examinations, supplemented with pul-
monary, pelvic and soft tissue scans. Shorter et al. report
using a hand-held ultrasound device in the aftermath of
the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Ultrasound changed the
clinical management in 70% of patients evaluated, such
as surgical referral, clinical observation instead of previ-
ously planned surgery, decisions about transfer to a
higher level of care or use of certain medications [38].
Shah et al. report on the usefulness of a hand-carried
ultrasound device in triaging and treating crush injury
victims in Haiti [39]. After a hurricane and mudslide in
Guatemala in 2005, a hand-carried ultrasound machine
was deployed. A total of 137 scans were performed in
10 days, and almost nine of ten scans required a curved
array probe [40]. A hand-held ultrasound device was also
successfully used to modify an established triage algo-
rithm for rapid assessment with FAST examination after
an earthquake in China [41]. Another report from China
illustrates the immediate impact of ultrasound-guided
assessment on the initial resuscitation of earthquake
victims [42]. Given the degree of traumatic injuries seen
after natural disasters, the most common sonographic
evaluations performed in these studies aimed at

diagnosing intra-abdominal haemorrhage and pneumoth-
oraces. In addition, a significant number of scans was
carried out to evaluate pregnancy complications, muscu-
loskeletal injuries or hepatobiliary disease.
Characteristics of different portable ultrasound devices
Table 2 lists all currently commercially available hand-
held or hand-carried ultrasound systems. This overview
includes all devices discussed in the studies that are
included in this review. All systems typically have some
form of integration with imaging storage and manage-
ment systems, as well as internal storage for images,
video clips, voice and text annotations. As these features
are less used in the environments described in this article,
they are excluded from the table to improve clarity.
Discussion
Ultrasound appears to be the ideal imaging modality at
the bedside as no other imaging technology requires as
little infrastructure and maintenance as ultrasound. Ultra-
sound gel, the only routine supply item needed, can easily
be produced locally [43]. Based on previous data, ultra-
sound has been categorised as ‘essential’ for better patient
care in LMIC [44]. Hence, we assessed the available sci-
entific literature to provide an update on the current situ-
ation of hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound devices
in LMIC.
Our systematic literature review reveals that hand-car-
ried and hand-held ultrasound devices are used for a vari-
ety of different indications. In particular, these devices
appear to be frequently used for echocardiographic appli-
cations and in disaster situations. Attempts have also
been made to formally define their indication for use by
including ultrasound in patient care protocols. The most
commonly reported geographical area of use in LMIC is
sub-Saharan Africa. Data assessing the resulting impact
of ultrasound findings on patient management are scarce,
but in this review portable ultrasound led to a modifica-
tion of clinical management in up to 70% of reported
cases [38, 45]. The technical features and specifications
of the devices used vary widely with regard to imaging
modes and screen size.
Our search resulted mainly in original research articles,
although mostly representing observational data from
case series. The overall level of evidence is low, and high-
quality, objective studies analysing the use and impact of
hand-carried and hand-held ultrasound devices are
needed to better inform key stakeholders and policy mak-
ers. Despite previous calls for more rigorous studies on
the impact of portable ultrasound devices, there has been
a lack of funding to support these efforts [46]. However,
high-quality data are urgently needed to assess the longi-
tudinal impact of readily available, bedside ultrasound
diagnosis and treatment in LMIC. Indeed, ultrasound
could be of particular relevance in these settings, because
several neglected tropical diseases are endemic in LMIC
for which international guidelines highly recommend the
use of ultrasound imaging, for example echinococcosis
and schistosomiasis [47–49]. Likewise, the utility of
hand-held devices for improved diagnosis and clinical
patient management in LMIC has already been reported
for other specific diagnostic areas, for example hand-held,
battery-run microscopes for the diagnosis of intestinal
parasites in settings without laboratory infrastructure and
with no constant access to electricity [50–52].
Anecdotally, the authors themselves have employed
hand-carried ultrasound devices, and the hand-held GE
Vscan Dual (General Electric, Fairfield, CT, USA), in
LMIC. We have successfully diagnosed and managed
increased intracranial pressure, ocular trauma, pneumoth-
orax, pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema,
systolic congestive heart failure, urinary retention, liver
cysts, deep vein thrombosis in these settings, where alter-
native imaging options were either not available alto-
gether, or not without significant delays in patient care.
One important drawback to the successful broad
implementation of ultrasound-based diagnostics in LMIC
is the lack of training in the majority of resource-con-
strained settings. In fact, there often is little to no formal
training for practising physicians [53]. Lack of qualified
clinicians able to provide ultrasound training has been
identified as one of the major barriers that need to be
addressed before a wider use of ultrasound imaging seems
feasible [4]. However, it has been shown that even short-
training courses may lead to significant knowledge reten-
tion and improve practical skills, even when prior ultra-
sound experience was minimal [54–57]. An international
initiative led by the University of Pavia in Italy is now
addressing the pressing need for improved training
regarding ultrasound application in the tropics through
the implementation of regular, expert-led short-term
training courses (http://www.tropicalultrasound.org), but
further funding for implementation of such programmes
in LMIC is urgently required. There are also other initia-
tives with a similar focus (http://www.pureultra-
sound.org).
While a number of portable ultrasound devices have
been commercialised, not all are truly hand-held, as
demonstrated in Table 2. The literature suggests that a
curved array probe is sufficient for the vast majority of
examination indications, which are mostly of abdominal
and obstetric nature [40, 44–46]. These findings may help

D. M. Becker et al. Ultrasound in resource-limited settings
manufacturers to design affordable, easy-to-use devices
that focus on battery life and rugged design rather than
on multiple transducer probes.
Our review has several limitations. First, we may have
missed reports from small journals published in LMIC, as
these are often not included in the literature databases
searched for this review. This is particularly true for sci-
entific journals that are not published in English. For
instance, it is likely that many researchers from non-Eng-
lish speaking LMIC prefer to submit manuscripts to jour-
nals that are published in the regionally most important
language, such as French (West and Central Africa),
Spanish (Latin America) or Portuguese (Brazil). Such a
publication bias may partially explain why most manu-
scripts reviewed here have been written by authors from
high-income countries. Second, the lack of well-designed
studies that assess the utility and clinical impact of hand-
held and hand-carried ultrasound devices limits the valid-
ity of our conclusion. Specifically, the reported data on
the impact of portable ultrasound clinical management
are likely overestimating its true effect, as it is commonly
seen with observational studies [58].
In summary, this review highlights the potential for
portable ultrasound devices in LMIC, and hand-held
machines in particular. However, so far the lack of suffi-
cient data pertaining to the role of portable ultrasound
systems for improved management of certain clinical syn-
dromes does not allow for general practice recommenda-
tions. We conclude that there is a need to scientifically
assess and evaluate the use of these devices in LMIC at a
large scale to better define the scope, impact and
potential benefits of hand-carried ultrasound in
resource-constrained settings worldwide.
