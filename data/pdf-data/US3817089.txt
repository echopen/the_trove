ROTATING PROBE HIGH DATA ACQUISTION
RATE APPARATUS
This is a division, of application Ser. No. 158,154,
filed June 30, 1971.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates in general to medical instru
ments for observing organs of the body and in particu
lar to those which may be inserted into the body for de
tailed observations.
2. Description of the Prior Art
The study of internal organs of the body has proved
to be very difficult, however, it has been known that the
dynamics of organs such as the heart are very impor
tant in studying and treating heart abnormalities. At
tempts have been made to measure internal and exter
nal dimensions of the heart during the course of the
cardiac cycle and certain investigators have used mer
cury ?lled rubber tubing to measure changes in the cir
cumference of the heart for the study of geometric
changes in the‘left ventricle, particularly its shape dur
ing the cardiac cycle as the altered relation from mo
ment to moment between the internal volume and the
surface area. Changes in the wall thickness alter and
also modify the stress distribution across the ventricu
lar wall during the cardiac cycle. Other investigators
have utilized biplane cine?uoroscopy to measure car
diac dimensions in which the geometry of the left ven
tricle was studied by visualization of six lead beads
placed near the endocardium of this chamber. Studies
of the shape of the left ventricle have also been ob
tained through cine?uoroscopy using radiopaque me
dium injected into the ventricle with a cardiac catheter.
Unfortunately, this view of the heart is limited to two
planes and the third plane normal to the axial coordi
nates of the subject cannot be visualized.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention comprises a rotating catheter
which may be placed into the esophagus and coupled
to the surrounding tissue for maximum efficiency in
coupling ultrasonic energy to and from the transducer.
A plurality of ultrasonic transducers are mounted in the
rotating catheter and the tip of the rotating catheter
containing the transducers is placed such that the heart
may be observed by transmission and reception of ul
trasonic energy. The heart is particularly difficult to vi
sualize because of its motion and its location. It is sur- ,
rounded by acoustically opaque lung and bone and
there are only a few windows through which the heart
may be observed. The present invention utilizes these
windows to ultrasonic energy which exists between the
esophagus and the heart as well as the intercostal
spaces along the sternum and the catheter may be
placed into the esophagus of the cardiac patient with
out the undue risk inherent in placing a catheter di
rectly into the heart, particularly where the heart may
be irritable and subject to fibrillation due to disease and
in?rmity. As the catheter is rotated the various trans
ducers are commutated so that the sector directed
toward the heart may be observed by detecting and
presenting the ultrasonic echoes received. Means are
provided for commutating the pulses and echoes to the
rotating transducers and for presenting the information
on a suitable display and recording apparatus. The

maximum data acquisition rate is used limited only by
the speed of sound in tissue.
Other objects, features and advantages of the inven
tion will be readily apparent from the following de
scription 1‘ of certain preferred embodiments thereof

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
EMBODIMENTS
The present invention comprises an instrument
which will allow real time examination of the heart dy
namics using a noninvasive ultrasonic technique. The
system allows the structure of the heart to be observed
during its contractile cycle at rates of 24 frames per
second. The heart may be observed on a monitor in a
two-dimensional cross section either continuously or
observed on a single frame by frame basis.
The invention includes a catheter having an array of
ultrasonic transducers at the tip with four ultrasonic
transducers which is inserted into the esophagus
through a protective sheath. The catheter may be ro
tated at a speed of 360 rpm for example and each of the
four transducers is utilized sequentially during the same
90° segment of rotation which segment corresponds to
the direction of the heart from the esophagus. Thus,
four sequential frames of information are obtained for
each revolution of the catheter.
The catheter may be inserted into the esophagus or
on the chest wall of the patient rather than directly into
the heart. This method is less traumatic to the patient
and can be used under conditions where insertion of a
catheter directly into an ailing heart would not be pos
sible. The invention allows the performance of an ailing
heart to be studied under conditions which are not
available at present through any other means.
FIG. 1 illustrates an esophageal probe 10 which com
prises an outside sheath 11 which is connected to a
housing 12. A motor 17 is connected to the housing 12
and has a gear train 18 which is connected to a rotating
catheter 13 which is mounted in the sheath II. The ro
tating catheter 13 has a tip 14 which has a plurality of
ultrasonic transducers 16a~l6d mounted therein. The
transducers 1641-1611 may be selectively connected so
as to transmit ultrasonic energy and receive ultrasonic
pulses and supply them to the presentation means.
A shaft 19 extends upwardly from the gear train 18
and passes through a commutator 21 and a resolver 22.
3,817,089

An input-output lead 24 is coupled to the rotating
catheter through a support 23 and the lead 24 is con
nected to a pulser 26 and receiver 27. The receiver 27
supplies an output to a display device 28 which might,
for example, be a cathode ray tube which has a display
portion 29 on which radial sweeps 31 are presented.
Echoes are presented as a trace 32.
A camera unit 33 may make permanent record of the
information obtained from the rotating catheter and
may take movies of the output on the scope 29 or may
alternatively take a plurality of still pictures, depending
upon the type of camera utilized.
A radial sweep generator 37 supplies an output to the
pulser 26 to control its output pulses and also supplies
output to the X and Y multipliers 36 and 34, respec
tively, which control the X and Y traces of the oscillo
scope 28. The sine-cosine potentiometer 22 supplies
inputs to the X sweep logic 38 and the Y sweep logic
39. The X sweep logic 38 supplies an input to the X
multiplier 36 and the Y sweep logic 39 supplies an
input to the Y multiplier 34.
FIG. 2 is an enlarged exploded view of the rotating
catheter and sheath of the invention. The rotating cath
eter 13 has a tip 14 which supports the four piezoelec
tric transducers l6a—l6d which are mounted at 90° an
gles in the tip 14. Leads 41, 42, 43 and 44 are respec
tively connected to the transducers 16a-16d and pass
up through the rotating catheter 13 which is hollow to
the commutating means 21. The stationary shield 11
encases the rotating catheter 13 and has a tip portion
72 which surrounds the'transducers 16a-16d and which
efficiently couples the ultrasonic energy from the trans
ducers. The tip cover 72 might be made of L100 Du
Pont urethane plastic, for example. An in?atable bal
loon 73 surrounds the lower end of the catheter and is
, attached to the metal sheath 11 and may be ?lled by
?uid so as to in?ate it such that the walls of the balloon
73 engage the walls of the esophagus so as to improve
the coupling between the transducers l6a-16d and the
tissue under observation. A supply tube 77 passes
through an opening 76 in the stationary sheath 11 and
at the upper end of the catheter fluid may be supplied
to the balloon 73 so as to in?ate it. A water-gelatin mix
ture may be used which has good acoustical character
istics.
Fluid 79 is mounted between the rotating catheter 13
and the inside wall of the stationary sheath 11. Such'
?uid provides lubricant for the ?exible shaft 13 within
the catheter and also serves as a transmission medium
for the sound from the transducers to the tissue under
. observation. A silicon oil operates satisfactorily for this
purpose.
It is to be realized that the catheter sheath 11 as well
as the ?exible shaft 13 may be ?exible so as to follow
the contours of the body for insertion into the esopha
gus of a patient. The inside of the ?exible sheath 13 is
filled with air and the electrical supply leads 41-44 for
the transducers 16a-16d pass up through the ?exible
rotating housing 13. The housing 13 may be a ?exible
stainless steel shaft constructed of right and left helices
to maximize the torsional stiffness of the rotating as
sembly within the stationary housing 11. The ?exible
shaft 13 might be type Q4697 manufactured by S. S.
White and Company.
The leads 41-44 are coaxial cable and might be type
UT8 which is a miniature coax cable manufactured by

Uniform Tubes Company and provides an appropriate
impedance match.
The transducers 16a-16d might comprise ferro
electric material which is lead metaniobate LM302
manufactured by the General Electric Company.
The commutator 21 allows electrical inputs and out
puts to be supplied respectively to the transducers
l6a-16d. The commutating is accomplished by reed
switches and a magnetic switching arrangement.
The upper end 19 of rotating shaft 13 is connected
to a pair of rotating discs 46 and 61. The disc 46 has
mounted thereon four reed switches 47, 48, 49 and 51
mounted at 90°points on the surface of the disc and then"
coaxial leads 41-44 are respectively connected to the
switches 47-51. An input lead 52 is connected to the
other side of all of the reed switches 47-51 and the reed
switches are of the type such that they are open when
not subject to a magnetic field and closed when sub- '
jected to a magnetic ?eld. The disc 61 comprises an an
nular permanent magnet. A shield 62 is mounted be
tween the discs 46 and 61 and is formed with an open
ing 71 of 90° such that magnetic ?ux from the disc 61
may close one of the switches 47-51 when the switches
are in the gap 71 of the shield 62. The shield 62 is sup
ported from the housing 12 and thus as the shaft 19 ro
tates the switches 47-51 will be sequentially closed so
that one of the transducers 1641-16 d will be connected
to the pulse and receiver as the shaft 13 rotates 90°.
After rotating 90° the particular transducer will be dis
connected from the pulser and receiver because its as
sociated switch will open and the switch for the next
adjacent transducer will be closed. Thus, means are
provided for scanning a 90° sector from the tip of the
catheter by the transducers l6a-l6d.
As shown in FIG. 3 the common lead 52 from the
switches 47-51 pass up to a mercury contact 53. The
upper end 54 of lead 52 extends into the mercury
contact 53 and the input-output lead 24 extends into
the mercury contact 53 so as to supply electrical energy
to and from the catheter.
FIG. 4 is a detailed view of the upper end of rotating
shaft 19 and the mercury contact 53 which is supported
from the walls of the shaft 19 by supporting means 99
and contains mercury 78. The lead 24 passes through
the coupling 23 supported by the housing of the poten
tiometer 22 and thus the mercury 78 continuously
makes electrical contact between the upper end 54 of
lead 52 and lead 24.
FIG. 5 is an electrical schematic view of the pulser of
this invention and has an input contact 81 which re
ceives the output of the radial sweep generator 37
which is applied through a condenser C1 and a resistor
R2 to the base of a transistor T1. A resistor R1 is con
nected to ground and the input terminal 81. The emit
ter of transistor T1 is connected to ground and a resis
tor R3 is connected between the emitter and collector.
A resistor R13 is connected between the collector of
transistor T1 and a suitable biasing source. A Zener
diode D1 is connected between the collector of transis
tor T1 and ground. A capacitor C2 and the primary of
a transformer Ll are connected from the collector of
the transistor T1 to ground.
One end of the secondary of transformer L1 is con
nected to' the gate of an SCR through a resistor R4. Re
sistor R5 is connected from the gate to ground. The
cathode of the SCR is connected to ground and the
anode is connected to a suitable biasing source through
3,817,089
5
a resistor R6 and an inductor L2. The anode is also
coupled through a capacitor C3 to an output terminal
82 which is connected to lead 24 which is connected to
the catheter and to the receiver 27. The output pulse
84 is illustrated above the output terminal 82.
FIG. 6 illustrates the input of the portions of the re
ceiver 27 which includes a clamper and video ampli
tier. The clamper circuit is desired so as to prevent the
receiver from being saturated upon the output of the
pulser 26 since the pulser output is at a much higher
voltage level than that of the echoes received from the
transducers 16a~16d. The input terminal 83 is con
nected to lead 24 from the catheter and is coupled
through the capacitor C4 and inductor L3 to a pair of
resistors R16 and R17 and to the base of a transistor
T2. A pair of diodes D2 and D3 are connected between
the junction point of the inductor L3 and resistor R16
and ground. The anode of diode D3 is connected to
ground and the cathode of diode D2 is connected to
ground. The emitter'of transistor T2 is connected to the
input of the video ampli?er through capacitor C10. An
operational ampli?er 94 which might be for example a
type MC1510G receives the output of the clamper cir
cuit and applies output through resistor R26 and capac
itor C12 to the base of transistor T3. The collector of
transistor T3 is coupled to the output terminal 96
through a capacitor C14.
In the clamper circuit the collector of transistor T2
is connected to a suitable biasing source through a re
sistor R21. A capacitor C3 is connected between the
collector of the transistor T2 and ground. A resistor
R19 is connected between a suitable biasing source and
the resistor R20 which is connected to the emitter of
transistor T2. A capacitor C9 is connected from the re
sistor R20 to ground. Diode D7 has its cathode con
nected to the base of transistor T2 and its anode to
ground. A diode D6 has its anode connected to the
base of transistor T2 and its cathode connected to a ca
pacitor C7 which has its other side grounded. A resistor
R18 is in parallel with capacitor C7.
A capacitor C5 is connected to the junction point be
tween resistors R16 and R17 and has its other side con
nected to a pair of diodes D4 and D5. The diode D5 has
its cathode connected to ground and the diode D4 has
its anode connected to a capacitor C6 and to a resistor
R15 which has its other side connected to wiper
contact 90 which engages a resistor R14. A suitable bi
asing voltage is connected to one end of the resistor
R14 and the other end is connected to ground.
The emitter of transistor T3 is connected to a suitable
biasing source through resistor R30 which has a capaci
tor C13 in parallel with it. A diode D8 has its cathode
connected to ground and its anode connected to resis
tors R25 and R31. The other side of resistor R25 is con
nected to the operational ampli?er 94 and a capacitor
C11 which has its other side connected to ground. Re
sistor R31 is connected between the resistor R30 and
resistor R25. A resistor R29 is connected from the base
of transistor T3 to the resistor R31. A resistor R32 is
connected between resistors’ R22 and R28. Resistor
R28 has its other side connected to the collector of
transistor T3. Resistor R33 is connected between the
base of transistor T3 and resistor R32.
ln operation this invention allows both the internal
and external structure of the heart to be observed dur
ing its normal cycle at rates of 24 frames per second.
The heart may be observed on a display unit 28 and a

two-dimensional cross section either continuously or
may be photographed by the camera 33 on a single
frame-by-frame basis.
In a particular embodiment, the 5 MHz piezoelectric
transducers 16a-16d were 5 mm in diameter and the
catheter 13 was rotated at 360 rpm and each of the four
transducers were sequentially utilized during the same
90° segment of rotation. Thus four sequential frames of
information are displayed per revolution. As each of
the transducers falls within the 90° segment in which
their associated switches 47, 48, 49 and 51 are closed,
it will be pulsed by the pulser 26 and ultrasonic energy
will pass from the transducer through the coupling ?uid
between the transducer and the protective capsule 72
then through the fluid 74 and through the walls of the
balloon 73. The energy then will pass through the
esophagus to the heart tissue and will be reflected from
the heart back through the esophagus, the balloon 73,
the fluid 74, the capsule 72 and through the silicon oil
to the transmitting transducer '16. The energy will then
pass to the receiver 27 and will be displayed on the
cathode ray tube 29. .
The radial sweep generator 37 produces two output
signals: one a 5 R112 sawtooth; and, the second a pulser
sync pulse which occurs at the beginning of each saw
tooth. The pulser gate is supplied to the pulser 26 to ini
tiate its operation and the pulser transmits a pulse
through the coaxial cable 24 and the mercury pool
cable connector 53. From the mercury pool connector
53 the pulse passes through the coaxial cable 52 which
is rotating along with the hollow sine-cosine potentiom
eter 22 and to the commutator 21. The commutator
sends the pulse to one of the four coaxial cables of the
hollow center of the catheter wall 13 to one of the ap
propriate transducers 16a~16d at the catheter tip 14.
The echo received from the tissue interfaces then re
turns along the same path as that which the transmitted
pulse follows to the receiver 27. The receiver is a 5
MHz high-gain amplifier and produces the signals for
the Z input to the display unit 28.
So that the echoes are displayed in the proper posi
tion on the display unit 28, the rotary coupled sine
cosine potentiometer 22 transmits four signals to the
sweep logics 38 and 39. It is to be realized that the sine
cosine potentiometer 22 is a standard commercial item
and that it produces output proportional to sin 0, sin (0
+ 90°), cos 6, and cos (0 + 90°). By logically gating
these signals repetitive 90° segments of sine 6 are trans
mitted to the X analog multiplier 36.‘Also, repetitive
90° segments of sine (B + 90°) are transmitted to the Y
analog multiplier 34. These signals modulate the saw
tooth wave from the radial sweep generator 37 and the
outputs of the multiplier_s 36 and 34 are fed directly to
the X and Y inputs of the display unit 28. In the partic
ular apparatus constructed, one radial sweep occurred
each 200 microseconds which was synchronized with
the position of the rotating transducer being utilized
during the one-fourth revolution under study. It is to be
realized, of course, that the one-fourth revolution uti
lized is that sector in which the heart falls from the po
sition of the transducer tip 14. Each tissue interface ap
pears as an intensi?ed dot along the radial sweep of the
beam of the display unit 28 and a series of approxi
mately 200 of these radial sweep lines slightly displace
from the previous one as the catheter rotates through
one 90° segment produces a two-dimensional cross
3,817,089‘
7
section of the heart. This cross section trace is illus
trated by numeral 32 in FIG. 1.
During continuous operation this is repeated four
times per revolution each corresponding to one of the
transducers passing through that 90° segment which is
being utilized and thus the real time dynamics of the
heart will be displayed on the indicator 28.
The present invention differs from the prior art in
that the maximum data acquisition rate is limited only
be the velocity of sound. Thus, in the design example
24 frames per second which comprises the normal
movie speed are obtained when the catheter is rotated
at 360 rpm. If the depth penetration of the ultrasonic
energy is limited to l5 cm a pulse repetition frequency
of 5,000 Hz will produce 208 lines per raster or 24
frames per second. This allows the maximum data ac
quisition rate and the dynamics of the heart will be im
mediately observed on the oscilloscope as the heart
changes position and size. -
It is seen that this invention provides new and novel
10
20
apparatus and means for observing the dynamics of the ‘
heart in real time so that the heart may be observed and
treated.
The visualization parameters may be optimized for a
particular diagnostic task to give the best display by
controlling the independent variables of frames per
second, frame sector angle and pulse repetition fre~
quency.
Although the invention has been described by using
a rotating catheter with four transducers, it is to be re
alized that the catheter could be oscillated about the
center of a sector and this would require that only one
transducer would be required in the catheter. Also the
commutator and multiple leads would be eliminated
with such oscillating structure.
Although minor modi?cations might be suggested by
those versed in the art, it should be understood that we
wish to embody within the scope of the patent war
