In this document, we will explain some basis of the acoustic theory to understand the propagation
of acoustic waves and the echographic process.
1 Propagation of acoustic waves
In this section, we will define the differents type of acoustic waves and some basic equations and
properties of the propagation of acoustic waves.
1.1 Wave types
An acoustic wave is a perturbation of the local state without displacement of the global state. Acoustic
waves are periodic, their spatial periodicity is given by the wavelength λ. Consider a medium at rest
such as on Fig. 1, where the particles are represented by the dots. Such a period structure represent a
metal for examples. When an acoustic wave propagate in this medium, the particles will have a local
displacement.
Figure 1: Medium at rest.
Their is two types of acoustic waves, the longitudinal waves (Fig. 2 also named P waves and the
transverse waves (Fig: 3 also named SH or SV waves. The longitudinal waves are compressional waves,
the direction of the displacement of the particles is the same than the direction of propagation of the
wave. The transverse waves are shear waves, the direction of displacement is then perpendicular to
the direction of propagation of the wave. In a fluid, such as the water, only longitudinal waves can
propagate. In the human body, the shear modulus is very small, it can be considered as a fluid, and
so only longitudinal waves will be generated.

1.2 Mathematical formulation
In acoustic, a fluid medium is describe by two mecanical parameters: the mass density ρ and the bulk
modulus κ. The bulk modulus relate the change of volume of a medium to the isostatic pressure apply
on it. The velocity of the acoustic wave c is:
c =
r
κ
ρ
, (1)
for example, for the water we have: ρ = 1000 kg.m−3
, κ = 2.19 MPa and c = 1480 m.s−1.
The mathematical formulation is obtained by solving the Helmholtz equation, for exemple, the
acoustic pressure p (x, t) can be expressed as:
p (x, t) =

A+
ei kx
+A−
e− i kx

e− i ωt
, (2)
A+ ei kx is a wave of amplitude A+, propagating toward the positive x, A− e− i kx is a wave of amplitude
A−, propagating toward the negative x. k =
ω
c
is the wavenumber, ω = 2πf the angular pulsation
and f the frequency.
When we make an echographic image, we are intresting only on the intensity of the wave:
I =
1
2
< [p (x, t) v∗
(x, t)] , (3)
where v (x, t) is the velocity of the particle, and x∗ represent the complex conjugate of x. It can be
shown with the Euler’s equation that the intensity is directly proportional to the square modulus of
the pressure.
1.3 Refraction and diffusion of acoustic waves
When an acoustic wave passes from a medium (0) to a second medium (1), a part of the wave is
reflected an the over part is transmitted through the interface. When the interface is flat in the point
of view of the wave, we have refraction (it is a quasi one dimensional problem, because the wave is
reflected only on only one direction of the space). When the wave see the curvature of the interface,
the wave is scattered on all the directions of the space, we talk then about diffusion.
1.3.1 Refraction of a wave
We consider a incident wave φinc normal to an interface, the reflected φR = Rφinc and the transmitted
φT = Tφinc waves are also normal to the interface (Fig. 4). R and T represent respectively the reflexion

and transmission coefficient. By solving this problem, we show that:
R =
Z2 − Z1
Z2 + Z1
(4)
where Zi = ρici is the acoustic impedance of the medium i.
If we consider, for example the reflection of a wave at an interface between water (ρ0 = 1000 kg.m−3
,
c0 = 1480 m.s−1) and a muscle (ρ1 = 1070 kg.m−3
, c1 = 1590 m.s−1), the the reflection coefficient is
equal to 69.10−3, so only 7% of the pressure is reflected. If we know consider an interface between wa-
ter and bone (ρ1 = 2175 kg.m−3
, c1 = 4000 m.s−1), then nearly 70% of the incident wave is reflected.
The echos due to bones are much more higher than the ones due to the muscles.
1.3.2 Scattering of a wave
Even if an object is very small in front of a wave, it always scattered the wave (Fig. 5). It is much
more complicated to determine the scattered wave than a reflected such as in sec. 1.3.1.

The diffused wave go in every direction of the space, it lead that its amplitude decreases with the
distance from the object.
1.4 Attenuative media
The human body is an attenuative media, this mean that the amplitude of a wave propagating in such
medium decrease along its direction of propagation. Mathematically, the propagation of waves in this
kind of medium is written as:
p (x, t) =

A+
ei kx
e−αx
+A−
e− i kx
eαx

e− i ωt
. (5)
The difference between the propagation of a wave between a non-attenuative and an attenuative
medium is present on Fig. 6. So when we do acoustic imaging in the human body, we must gradually
amplify the received signal if we want to convert correctly the analogical signal into a digital signal,
because if the amplitude of the signal is smaller the precision of the ADC, we can’t measure it (see
appendix A). Classically, we do Time Gain Compensation (TGC) on the receive signal in order to
keep a convenient amplitude of the receive signal. An example of this kind of treatment is presented
on Fig. 7, it’s apply to the attenuated signal on the right side of Fig. 6.

A ADC
In this appendix, we make a quick introduction to Analogical Digital Converter. This component is
one of the most important in an echographic probe, so it is necessary to understand how does it work.
As its name suggest, an ADC convert the algebrical value of the tension of a signal to a digital
signal. To remember, a digital signal is a binary signal, the 0 correspond to 0 V, the low value and
1 correspond correspond to high value (5 V for example). In a computer or smartphone, all the
treatment are made in digital form, so it is necessary to convert the analogical signal measured on the
transducer to a digital signal. An ADC is characterized by its sampling rate expressed in sampling
per second (Sps) and its precision n. The sampling rate define the number of time it convert a signal
per second. The precision define on how many bites the digital number is written, so the ADC sample
the signal on 2n values.
An ADC is supply with a given continuous current Vcc. So the ADC sampling of the analogical
are 2n value equally space between −Vcc (or 0V) and +Vcc. The precision p of the ADC is then:
p =
2Vcc
2n − 1
. (6)
So if we have Vcc = 5 V on a 8 bites ADC (n = 8), then the precision is then 39.2 mV. Now consider
than the output k of the ADC is an unsigned integer (this mean that the output is 0 to 255) then the
voltage Vm of the analogical signal is:
Vm = −Vcc + kp, (7)
so if k = 23 then the analogical signal is -4.1 V high.
