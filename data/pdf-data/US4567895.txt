FULLY WE'ITED MECHANICAL ULTRASOUND
SCANHEAD
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to mechanical scan
heads. In particular, it relates to a mechanical scanhead
of the type used in medical electronic diagnostic ultra
sound equipment.
Ultrasound is a non-invasive technique for generating
image scans of interior body organs. As is well known
in the art, there are a variety of types of ultrasound
transducers. These include elongated transducers, such
as phased array transducers and linear array transducers
which are fully electronic in beam forming and direct
ing, and various types of spherical transducers and an
nular arrays, which are typically scanned mechanically.
Mechanical scanheads typically utilize two tech
niques for generating sector scans. The ?rst technique,
which requires a plurality of transducers, is the rotating
scanhead unit, in which the various transducers are
rotated through 360 degrees and are turned on in suc
cession over a sector which corresponds to the sector
belng scanned. The second type ofmechanical scanhead
is an oscillating scanhead, sometimes called a “wob
bler”. In either type of mechanical scanhead, drive
means, such as a motor, must be connected to the trans
ducer in order to impart mechanical movement to the
rotor. In typical mechanical scanheads, ofthe type here
tofore used, the motor drive means is in a dry ambient
whereas the ultrasound transducer is typically im
mersed in an acoustic coupling medium such as mineral
oil. A problem which has heretofore existed with me
chanical scanheads, especially those which require a
plurality of transducers, is that they are very expensive
to manufacture due to the critical alignment of the vari
ous parts from which they are made. In addition, there
has always been a problem with the seals between the
dry portion of the scanhead, in which the motor is lo
cated, and the wet portion of the scanhead in which the
transducer is located. Heretofore, there has also been a
problem with determining the exact position of the
ultrasound transducer to a high degree of accuracy
when the encoder was mounted on the motor shaft.
This has required that very accurate, and expensive,
precision gearing be used to connect the scanhead to the
motor. As a result of the use of both a wetted area and
a dry area and the use of precision gears, mechanical
scanheads have typically been rather large when com
pared to phased array transducers. The excessive size of
mechanical scanheads has made them somewhat un
wieldy to use in some applications. Consequently, a less
expensive, more reliable, and smaller mechanical scan
head would be highly desirable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is an improved mechanical
ultrasound scanhead. The scanhead includes a sealed
housing with a rotor mounted in it. The rotor has at
least one ultrasound transducer mounted on it, and the
housing contains an ultrasound coupling ?uid. The
improvement in the present invention is that the motor
is mounted in the sealed housing, and the motor is cou
pled to the rotor by means of a drive belt rather than
through precision gearing. An encoder disk, mounter
on the rotor, is used in conjunction with feedback elec

tronics to control the speed of the rotor, whereby said
motor is fully wetted by the ultrasound coupling ?uid.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
INVENTION
Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, cross-sectional
views of the fully wetted mechanical scanhead 10 made
in accordance with the present invention are shown.
The scanhead 10 comprises a rotor 12 which houses
three transducers 14. These transducers 14 are spherical
transducers which may have the same frequency or
which may have multiple frequencies, as is well known
in the art.
The transducers 14 are mounted on the rotor 12
which is connected via a drive belt 16 to an electric
motor 18. Both the motor 18 and the rotor 12 are
mounted in close proximity to one another in a sealed
housing 26 within the scanhead 10. The use of the sealed
housing 26, ?lled with an ultrasound coupling ?uid, i.e.,
“a fully wetted region”, represents a departure from the
typical rotating scanhead which would separate the
rotor from the motor and would place the rotor in a wet
environment and the motor in a dry environment. Also,
the use of the drive belt 16, a non-precision item, means
that the scanhead 10 is signi?cantly less expensive to
manufacture than a scanhead having a conventional
design which would require a precision gear and seal, of
the type heretofore used.
The reason that the scanhead 10 is able to use a non
precision arrangement to drive the rotor 12 from the
motor 18 is that the scanhead 10 does not use an encod
ing device which mounted on the motor 18. In the
present invention, however, an encoder disk 20 is
mounted on the shaft of the rotor 12. Accordingly,
feedback means which include LED’s and the encoder
disk 20, can accurately keep track ofthe precise position
of the rotor 12. In the scanheads of the prior art, even
those using precision gearing, the precise position ofthe
rotor could only be determined inferentially. In the
present invention, however, even though signi?cantly
less expensive means are used to move the rotor 12, the
exact position of the rotor 12 can be determined. The
speci?c encoder arrangment which is used in the pres
ent invention is comprised of an encoder disk 20 having
a series of re?ective and non-re?ective lines thereon.
The lines are scanned by phototransmissive elements,
LEDs in the preferred embodiment, and re?ections are
picked up by photoreceptive elements, phototransistors
in the preferred embodiment. A unique feature of the
present invention that the photoelements are mounted
within the sealed housing containing the ultrasound
coupling ?uid. Accordingly, the optical characteristics
of the ultrasound coupling ?uid must be accounted for
by the encoder optics. Accordingly, the photoelements
are mounted in close proximity to the encoder disk, and,
4,567,895

in the preferred embodiment of the invention, no lenses
are used on the photoelements.
Other features of the present invention which help to
minimize manufacturing costs without sacri?ce to reli
ability or performance, include the fully molded mount
ing base into which the rotor is ?tted.
The particular motor 16 which is used in the pre
ferred embodiment of the invention is a shaft mounted
motor in which the casing rotates.
With continued reference to FIG. 2, the scanhead 10
further comprises a sealing bulkhead 24 which separates
' the sealed housing 26 from the dry portions in the cavity
28. Mounted on the bulkhead 24 is a bubble trap 30
which permits gas bubbles to rise through a funnel-like
aperature 32 into a cavity 34. When the cavity 34 is
?lled with ?uid to a point higher than the top 36 of the
funnel-like aperature 32, bubbles trapped in the bubble
trap 30 cannot escape. Periodically, gas is removed
from the bubble trap 30 by injecting additional fluid
through an opening 38 by removing a screw cap 40 (See
FIG. 4).
As stated above, the encoding apparatus is comprised
of a unit 42 (See FIG. 5) on which the phototransistors
and LEDs are mounted in pairs at locations generally
designated 44. The specific operation of the encoding
apparatus is not relevant to the present invention other
than to say that re?ections of light from the LEDs (not
shown) off the encoding disk 20 provide a speed feed
back mechanism for adjusting the speed of the motor
18, thereby adjusting the speed of the rotor 12, through
external electronics (not shown). The external electron
ics use signals on a cable 44 which passes through the
bulkhead 24 through a series of holes 46 form therein.
