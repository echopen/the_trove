ULTRASONIC SECTOR SCANNER UTILIZING
ROTATING TRANSDUCER
This invention relates generally to ultrasonic scan
ners such as used for medical diagnostic purposes, and
more particularly the invention relates to an ultrasonic
sector scanner in which a plurality of rotating transduc
ers are selectively energized for scanning.
Ultrasonic diagnostic systems are known and com
mercially available for diagnostic purposes. See for
example US. Pat. No. 4,172,386 for “Video A Trace
Display System For Ultrasonic Diagnostic System” and
US. Pat. No. 4,204,433 for “Computerized Ultrasonic
Scanner With Technique Select”. The commercially
available Datason ultrasound system of General Elec
tric Company provides both real time and static images
on a television video monitor.
Brie?y, such systems utilize sound transducers to
transmit ultrasonic waves (e.g. on the order of several
megahertz) into a patient and to receive echo signals. In
one mode of operation, the transducer is attached to a
plurality of hinged arms for movement in a single plane,
and potentiometers associated with the hinged arms
produce signals which identify the transducer position
and orientation. Alternatively, hand held multielement
electronically steered arrays or hand held mechanically
steered scanners can be used. The echo signals are ap
plied to a time gain compensated ampli?er to adjust the
echo signals for attenuation in passing through the pa
tient. The adjusted signals are then passed through an
analog to digital conversion and video processing cir
cuitry and thence to scan converter circuitry for display
formatting. The display comprises a plurality of pixels
in horizontal rows and vertical columns with each pixel
having a brightness level in response to the input signal.
Conventionally, the brightness is de?ned by a 32 level
Gray-scale, hence the pixel brightness level requires a
?ve bit digital code.
The hand held unit may be designed to display images
in a sector format. Such a sector scanner may be a
phased transducer array, an oscillating transducer, or a
rotating transducer or transducer set. The phased array
offers a high sample rate but its electronics are more
expensive than those for mechanical designs. The oscil
lating transducer is a simple design and relatively com
pact. However, oscillating transducers have previously
been designed with variable speeds yielding uneven
display line spacings and have typically had narrow
sector displays. The rotating transducer offers uniform
transducer speed and a wider sector angle than does the
oscillating transducer. However, a single transducer
will yield low image frame rates and a probe with a set
of transducers must have them accurately positioned
and rigidly supported to provide identical beam align
ment and attenuated sensitivity.
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is an
improved sector scanner utilizing a rotating set of trans
ducers.
Another object of the invention is a rotatable me
chanical support for a plurality of transducers which
provides accurate positioning and a rigid support.
A feature of the invention is a rotatable wheel support
having a circumferential rim surface. A plurality of
recessed seats are provided in the circumferential sur
face for receiving the transducers. Each seat has a cen
tral opening for transmission of ultrasonic energy to and

from the transducer mounted therein and facing in
wardly.
An ultrasonic sector scanner including the invention
comprises a housing, a shaft rotatably mounted in the
housing, and a motor mounted within the housing and
coupled to rotate the shaft. A transducer support wheel
is coupled to the shaft for rotating a plurality of trans
ducers which are mounted in the recessed seats in the
circumferential rim of the wheel.
In a preferred embodiment each transducer is gener
ally rectangular in shape, and each seat is generally
rectangular for receiving the transducer with each cor
ner of the seat having a support tab for supportably
receiving the transducer. The transducers face in
wardly, and acoustic mirrors mounted in the housing
direct acoustical waves between the transducers and
ultrasonic ports in the housing.
In accordance with another feature of the invention
the transducer support wheel includes a central hub
portion for mounting to the shaft and a plurality of
spokes extend from the hub to the rim surface. Each
recessed seat has associated therewith a spoke, and
electrical conductive means is provided on each spoke
associated with the seat for electrically contacting a
transducer in the seat.
The invention and objects and features thereof will be
more readily apparent from the following detailed de
scription and appended claims when taken with the
drawing, in which:
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an ultrasonic sector
scanner.
FIG. 2 is a section view of the sector scanner of FIG.
1 in accordance with one embodiment of the present
invention.
FIG. 3 is a plan view of a transducer support wheel in
accordance with the invention as used in the sector
scanner of FIG. 2. '
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a transducer receiving
seat as viewed along the line 5——5 of FIG. 3.
FIG. 5 is a top view of a transducer receiving seat as
viewed along the line 5-5 of FIG. 3. .
FIG. 6 is a side view of the transducer wheel of FIG.
3 with a hub assembly for mounting the wheel to the
rotating shaft of a sector scanner.
FIG. 7 is a side view in section of the support wheel
and hub assembly of FIG. 6 as mounted to the end
portion of a shaft.
Referring now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a perspec
tive view of an ultrasonic sector scanner which includes
a housing 10 of suitable con?guration for manual sup
port by an ‘operator. Housing 10 is enlarged at the end
portion 12 to accommodate a rotating transducer assem
bly as will be described further hereinbelow. Ports 14
and 16 provide for the transmission of ultrasonic energy
from the transducers within the housing portion 12 and
a patient undergoing examination. Signals received by
the transducers are passed through internal electronics
within housing 10 and through cable 18 to external
signal processing means (now shown) for processing
and display (further herein referred to as the system).
FIG. 2 is a section view of the sector scanner of FIG.
1 in accordance with the present invention. Mounted
within housing 10 is an electric motor 20 which rotates
a hollow shaft 22. Rotatably mounted on shaft 22 within
the housing portion 12 is a transducer assembly shown
generally at 24. The transducer assembly includes a
plurality of transducers (e.g. four) which are selectively
actuated to transmit and receive ultrasonic energy ei

ther through port 14 through use of acoustic mirror 26
or through port 16 through use of acoustic mirrors 28
and 30, as determined by the ultrasonographer. The
mirrors are ?xedly positioned on the housing for trans
mission of the acoustic energy from the transducers in
proper-time sequence.
Connected to the cable 18 is an electronic assembly
shown generally at 32 for controlling and processing
electrical signals to and from the transducer set. The
electronic circuitry 32 is electrically interconnected
with the transducer set by means of a plurality of
brushes shown generally at 34 which are mounted in a
brush block assembly 36 and which electrically and
physically engage slip-rings 38 mounted on the rotating
shaft 22. Conductive cable within the shaft 22 electri
cally interconnects the slip-rings 38 and the transducers,
and conductive means interconnect the brushes 34 and
the circuitry 32.
An indexing signal for identifying the position of the
transducer assembly 24 is provided to the system elec
tronic control circuitry by electro-optical means includ
ing an optical transmitter 40 and an optical detector 42
which are mounted in space alignment in the brush
block assembly 36. Mounted on shaft 22 is an indexing
wheel 44 the periphery of which passes between the
electro-optical transmitter 40 and detector 42. A notch
46 is provided in a peripheral portion of the disc 44
whereby the transmission of light through the notch
from transmitter 40 to detector 42 causes detector 42 to
generate an electrical signal which is transmitted to the
system. Thus, by physically positioning the disc 44 and
notch 46 on shaft 22 in proper alignment with the trans
ducer assembly 24, the indexing signal from optical
detector 42 provides a necessary timing reference for
the system. The brush and slip-ring assembly along with
the indexing disc are further described in copending
application Ser. No. 290,838, ?led Aug. 7, 1981.
FIGS. 3—7 further illustrate the transducer‘ support
wheel in the section scanner in accordance with the
invention. FIG. 3 is a plan view of the transducer sup
port wheel 24 with the hub portion removed therefrom.
As will be described hereinbelow with reference to
FIG. 6, a hub and spoke assembly is adhesively fastened
to the transducer support wheel 24. The wheel 24 in
cludes 4 recessed seats 55-58 which receive transduc
ers. The plurality of holes shown generally at 50, 51, 52
and 53 allow electrical wiring of transducer elements
and tuning components through the rim to the printed
circuit on the spoke assembly.
FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a portion of the wheel
24 further illustrating one of the recessed seats 58 look
ing from within the wheel, and FIG. 5 is a plan view of
the seat 58 looking from outside of the wheel along the
line 5-5 of FIG. 3. The wheel 24 has an outer rim
surface 60 in which the seat 58 is formed for receiving
the rectangular shaped planar transducer. Each corner
of the rectangularly shaped recessed seat 58 includes a
support tab 61 which receives a corner of the trans
ducer.
The transducer is maintained in place by a suitable
epoxy. Electrical wires interconnecting the transducer
with the electronic circuitry pass through the holes 64
at the periphery of the transducer seat.
FIG. 6 is a plan view of the transducer support wheel
24 with the hub 70 and spokes 71-74. The spokes 71-74
are part of a printed wire board which overlays the hub
70 and rim 24 and which is adhesively bonded to the
same. Printed wiring provided on opposing surfaces of

each spoke are interconnected to the transducers and to
tuning elements through holes 50, 51, 52 and 53 and to
the transducer again through the holes 64 as shown on
FIGS. 3, 4 and 5. One side of each spoke is ground and
the other side carries the appropriate ultrasonic signal.
At the hub end of each spoke 71-74 electrical wiring
81-84 connect the transducer signals through the slip
rings 38 and brushes 34 (FIG. 2) to the electronic cir
cuitry 32. A ?fth wire 85 connects the ground terminal
of each transducer to the ground of circuit 32.
FIG. 7 is a side view in section of the wheel and hub
assembly mounted on the shaft 22 with transducers 86
and 88 positioned in the recessed seats 55 and 58 of the
wheel. The transducers 86 and 88 face inwardly with
acoustic energy being transmitted between the trans
ducers and the ports 14 and 16 shown in FIG. 2 through
the acoustic mirrors 26, 28 and 30, respectively, as pre
viously described.
The transducer support wheel in accordance with the
present invention provides accurate alignment of the
transducers in the sector scanner and rigidly support the
transducers during operation. Thus, identical beam
alignment is realized from each of the transducers se
lected for a single wheel because of their identical atten
uated sensitivity.
