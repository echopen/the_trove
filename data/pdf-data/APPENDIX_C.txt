APPENDIX C:
THE RLC CIRCUIT MODEL FOR A PIEZOELECTRIC
TRANSDUCER
In this appendix, the equivalent RLC circuit model as presented by Bechmann and
Fair [1966] is analyzed. First, an expression for the electrical input impedance for the
model will be derived in terms of the circuit elements. Then the values of the circuit
elements for the air backed crystal will be provided.
Input Impedance of the RLC Circuit
The RLC circuit model for the piezoelectric transducer is shown in Figure C.1

From Equation (C.2), it is clear that the real part of the admittance will achieve a

Element Parameters in the RLC Model
Although a complete analysis of the RLC model is beyond the scope of this
thesis, some closed form expressions for the values of the circuit parameters for an air
backed crystal will be provided. By including all of the relevant terms in the analysis
provided by O’
Brien [2000] it can be shown that for the air backed case the element
parameters are

the crystal is radiating. From these expressions, it is clear that a voltage drop across R1
would correspond to power radiated by the crystal. Before, leaving this section, it is
