[57] ABSTRACT
An improved high resolution rotating head ultrasonic
scanner is provided for use in an ultrasonic scanning
subsystem of an ultrasonic breast scanning system. The
scanning subsystem of the breast scanning system in
cludes a pair ofhigh resolution ultrasonic rotating scan
ning heads mounted on a transport mechanism. A scan
is conducted by moving the transport mechanism while
the scanning heads rotate so that a series of parallel
uniformly spaced cross-sectional scans of the tissue of
the breast are conducted from the inferior to the supe
rior border' of the breast. Each scanning head has three '
ultrasonic transducers uniformly spaced around its pe
rimeter. The focal ranges of the transducers of a given
scanning head are chosen so that a sector scan con
ducted by each head is divided into slightly overlapping
zones with the depth of each zone corresponding to the
focal range of one of the transducers on each scanning
head. The angular velocity and phase of the scanning
heads are controlled so that during one revolution of
the scanning heads each transducer of each head con
ducts a sector scan primarily through its zone. How
ever, only one such transducer will conduct such a scan
at any one time.

HIGH RESOLUTION ROTATING HEAD
ULTRASONIC SCANNER
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
This invention is in the ?eld of medical ultrasonic.
diagnostic equipment and more particularly relates to
improved high resolution rotating head ultrasonic scan
ners particularly adapted for use in the scanning subsys
tem of an ultrasonic breast scanning system.
2. Description of the Prior Art
There are statistical data up to and including the early
1970’s to the effect that there has been essentially no
change in the death rate from cancer of the breast of
American women. Early detection is the most signi?
cant factor in improving the probability of survival of a
patient with breast cancer.
The primary methods of detecting cancerous
growths within the breast are manual palpation, X-ray
examination, which includes mammography and xero
radiography and thermography. Each of the foregoing
techniques has its advantages but each has serious limi- -
tations with respect to its use for the early detection of
breast carcinoma. Fry, E. K., Kossof, G., Hindman, H.
A., Jr., The Potential of Ultrasonic Visualization for
Detecting of Abnormal Structure Within the Female
Breast, IEEE, Ultrasonic Symposium Proceedings, pp.
25-30, 1972.
In the early 1950’s the potential for using ultrasound
visualization systems to detect breast carcinoma was
demonstrated. Some of the advantages of ultrasonic
visualization techniques are that ultrasound is noninva
sive, can be externally applied, is nontraumatic and is
safe at the acoustical intensities and duty cycles encoun
tered in existing diagnostic equipment. While the poten
tial of ultrasound visualization of breast tissue has been
recognized and the need for ultrasonic breast scanning
instruments or systems is also recognized, the develop
ment of such instruments for clinical use in screening
large numbers of patients has not heretofore been ac
complished.
In order to detect as early as possible breast carci
noma, or precancerous conditions, the resolution of
visualizations of the tissue scanned must be good. Such
resolution is improved by not distorting the breast tissue
during the examination. One way of accomplishing this
is to have the patient’s breasts freely ?oating in a liquid
such as water, which liquid serves as the coupling me
dium for transmitting ultrasonic energy from a trans
ducer to the tissue and re?ections from transmitted
pulses of such energy from sources within the tissue due
primarily to changes in speed of transmission of the
sound in the tissue back to the transducer. In addition,
such an instrument should not cause the patient to suffer
any discomfort and should require a minimum of time to
prepare the patient for examination. Sucn an instrument
should conduct an examination quickly and reliably
without requiring highly skilled technicians or opera
tors to operate the instrument.
In conducting an ultrasonic examination of breast
tissue, it is important that the liquid level in the examina
tion tank in which the patient’s breasts are immersed be
maximized so that the tissue under the patient’s arms
can be examined to detect the possibility of the spread
of breast cancer. Prior art ultrasonic breast scanners in
which the patient’s breasts are immersed in a liquid have
tried to con?ne the liquid by a liquid tight seal between
5
15
35
40

the patient and the tank. A problem with such prior art
breast scanners is that they have not been successful in
minimizing the amount of liquid escaping from the ex
amination tank during an examination.

Flaherty et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,480,002, discloses an
ultrasonic system especially designed for breast exami
nation. A single transducer is mounted on a carriage so
that the transducer can be moved relative to the patient
while the transducer is oscillated to conduct a scan in
one plane through a patient’s breast. The transducer is
immersed in water within a water bag which is placed
over one or both of the patient’s breasts as illustrated in
FIGS. 1 and 2. As an alternative, in FIG. 5, the patient
is prone on a table through which her breasts may ex
tend into a tank ?lled with water within which the ,
transducer is positioned. Echoes received by the trans

describes an ultrasonic breast scanning system which
uses a single wide apertured focused transducer in pro
viding each image ofthe tissue scanned. Improved reso
lution of the images produced is accomplished with the
aid of a digital computer which allows segmented con
struction of echograms by moving the transducer rela
tive to the patient’s skin and controlling receiver gain to
select the depth range of interest.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides an improved high
resolution rotating head ultrasonic scanner particularly
adapted for use in a scanning subsystem of an ultrasonic
breast scanning system which is provided with a pair of
such ultrasonic scanners with each scanner having a
rotating scanning head. A plurality of wide apertured
focused ultrasonic transducers are mounted on each
head. The scanners are mounted on a transport assem
bly and scanners and transport assembly make up the
scanning subsystem. The scanning subsystem is de
signed to operate while immersed in a liquid such as
4,233,988
3
water in an examination tank which is positioned within
an over?ow tank. The transport assembly has a pair of
straight rails which are substantially parallel to each
other. A truss or bridge runs on the rails. The bridge has
a longitudinal axis which is normal to the direction of
the rails. A movable carriage is mounted on the bridge
to move in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of
the bridge. The bridge and carriage are movable so that
the carriage can be placed at any point within a prede- -
termined area and substantially bounded by said rails.
Pulleys are mounted on the rails and bridge and a pair of
?exible cables are connected around them and to the
carriage to control the direction and velocity of move
ment of the carriage and the bridge or both. Means for
applying power to selected ones of the pulleys or to the
?exible cables to control the movement of the carriage
and bridge are provided. A ?ipping mechanism is incor
porated into the movable carriage to orient the scanning
heads so that the beams of focused ultrasonic energy
from each transducer will be substantially normal to the
surface of the breast being scanned.
The scanners are mounted at the end ofa pair of ?xed
arms which are pivotally mounted on the carriage.
Each scanner has a scanning head mounted for rotation
on its body about an axis of rotation which is substan
tially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bridge.
Each headmhas a plurality of ultrasonic wide apertured
focused transducers and each transducer is adapted to
be connected to an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver
in sequence. Each transducer of a given scanning head
has a different focal range. The transducers are con
nected to the transmitter receivers so that they conduct
overlapping sector scans with each sector being divided
into slightly overlapping zones, the width of each zone
substantially corresponding to the focal ranges of the
transducers of each scanning head. The transducers of
each scanning head are uniformly distributed around
—0
5
35
the perimeter of its scanning head and so that the axis of _
its focused beam of ultrasonic energy when produced is
substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation-of the
scanning head on which they are mounted and substan
tially lie in the same plane. A motor is mounted in the
body portion of each scanner to rotate the scanning
heads at the same predetermined angular velocity in the
same direction and at a predetermined phase angle, or
relationship, to one another to provide overlapping
sector scans of tissue which tissue is substantially uni
formly distributed with respect to the perpendicular
bisector of the line between the axes of rotation of the
scanning heads. The scanners are constructed and con
trolled so that only one transducer of any one scanning
head will be operationally connected to the transmit
ter/receiver at any one time and veach transducer will be
so connected to the transmitter/receiver once during
each revolution of each scanning head.
The transport mechanism is controlled to position the
scanners so that they are substantially equidistantly
spaced from the breast to be scanned, so that the per
pendicular bisector of a line between the axes of rota
tion of the scanning heads of the scanners passes
through the nipple at an angle substantially normal to
the patient’s rib cage with the result that the beams of
focused ultrasonic energy from each transducer will be
substantially normal to the surface of the breast being
scanned.
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide
an improved high resolution rotating head ultrasonic
scanner.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
INVENTION
In FIG. 1, the subsystems and components of some of
the subsystems of ultrasonic breast scanning system 19
are illustrated. Some of the components of the scanning
subsystem 12 are also illustrated in FIG. 1 such as the
transport mechanism 14 and the motor, or motors, 16
for the transport mechanism. In FIG. 1 motors 18 that
drive or rotate the ultrasonic transducers 20 of scanning
subsystem 12 are illustrated.
The solid state relays 22 are used to control the ener
gization of motors 18 and in particular to control the
phase of the scanning heads which are not illustrated in
FIG. 1 on which the ultrasonic transducers 20 are
mounted as will be described later. Transducers 20
which are in a preferred embodiment wide apertured
focused ultrasonic transducers are operationally con
nected by slip rings 23 to a conventional ultrasonic
transmitter/receiver 24.
System 10 operates in a pulse echo mode with trans- ,
mitter/receiver 24 producing pulses of electrical en
ergy. In a preferred embodiment the pulses produced by
transmitter/receiver 24 have a pulse repetition rate of
3.4133 kHz with each pulse having a pulse width of 0.1
usec. The frequency of the ultrasound waves produced
by transducers 20 in response to the electrical pulses
applied to them from transmitter/receiver 24 is in the
range of from 1 to 10 MHz in the preferred embodi
ment. The pulses ofelectrical signals produced by trans
mitter/receiver 24 are applied to one of the ultrasonic
transducers 20 which in responseto the electrical sig
nals applied to it produces acoustic energy having a
frequency depending on the construction of the trans
ducer and the material used. During periods of time
between acoustic pulses, echoes produced by the re?ec
tions of the transmitted pulses of acoustic energy pri
marily from the interfaces within tissues having differ
ent acoustical impedances are received by the trans
ducer transmitting the pulse in the preferred embodi
ment and are converted by that transducer to electrical
signals, the amplitudes ofthe electrical signals produced
being a function of the amplitude of the acoustic signals
received. The electrical signals from the transducers are
applied to transmitter/receiver 24 through slip ring
assemblies 23.
Control, including timing, of ultrasonic scanning
system 10 is performed by a microcomputer 26 which in
the preferred embodiment is a MOS Technology Model
6502. The timing signals used by system 10 are derived
from the clock of microcomputer 26 as is well known in
the art. Typically the clock is a crystal controlled oscil
lator together with appropriate frequency dividers to
provide signals or pulses of the frequencies needed.
Transmitter/receiver 24 produces a transmission pulse,
when a transmit signal (Xmit) is applied to transmitter/
receiver 24 by controller 26. Control computer 26 be
ginning at the time it produces an Xmit signal will pro
duce a time gain control signal (TGC) which varies the
gain of the receiver of transmitter/receiver 24 to com
pensate for the rapid attenuation of acoustic signals
re?ected back to a transducer 201as a function of time as
is well known in the art. The echoes received by a
transducer 20 are converted or made into electrical
signals, an A mode signal which is applied to signal
processor 28. An A mode signal is one suitable for being
5
20
25
40
45
60
65
6
applied to a time base oscilloscope for displaying the
amplitudes of the received echoes. Signal processor 28
converts the A mode signals from receiver 24 into ultra
sonic video or intensity modulated signals.
The ultrasonic video signals from processor 28 are
applied to a conventional scan converter 30 to which‘
also is applied signals “X” and “Y” from sweep genera
tor 32. “X” and “Y” are the coordinates of the ultra~
sonic video signal at any given instant in time so that an
intensity or Z axis modulated display of the sources of
the echoes received by a transducer or transducers can
be mapped out as a two-dimensional cross-section view.
The Xmit signal from controller 26 which ultimately
causes a transducer 20 to produce a pulse of acoustic
energy is also applied to sweep generator 32 so that the
distance “r” of the source of an' echo received by a
transducer can be determined since r=c t/2 where c
equals the velocity of sound in the medium. The sine,
cosine functions of 0, the angle of the scanning trans
ducer at any given time is supplied to sweep generator
32 by controller 26 using a table of the values of sin 0,
cos 0 which are stored in the memory of computer 26.
Knowing r, sin 6 and cos 6, sweep generator 32 calcu
lates X and Y the coordinates of the ultrasound video
signal applied to scan converter 30 at time t.
Scan converter 30 accepts information in one mode
such as random X-Y patterns which are intensity modu
lated by the ultrasound video signals from signal proces- '
sor 28 and converts this information into video signals,
for example, suitable for display on conventional TV
display 34 on a real time basis. The video signals from
scan converter 30 can be stored on a video recorder 36
so that the video signals of any or all images so recorded
can be reproduced and displayed at a later time on TV
display or monitor 34, for example. Keyboard 38 is used
by the operator of the ultrasonic scanning system 10 to
apply commands and to supply data to system 10.
In FIG. 2 scanners 40, 42 of scanning subsystem 12
can be seen. Scanners 40, 42 are mounted on a pair of
supporting arms 44, 46, only arm 44 is seen in FIG. 2,
which arms are mounted on a movable carriage 48 of
the transport mechanism 14. Scanning subsystem 12 is
located in examination tank 50. Examination tank 50 is
located within over?ow tank 51. The capacity of tank
51 is such that if conventional valve 52 in the bottom
wall of examination tank 50 is opened all the liquid in
tank 50 can drain into overflow tank 51. Overlying
tanks 50, 51 is an examination table 53 which is provided
with an examination opening 54. A drainage opening 55
is formed in table 53 substantially surrounding examina
tion tank 50 so that liquid from examination tank 50 that
over?ows the top of examination tank 50 will ?ow into
and be collected in over?ow tank 51. A submersible
pump 56 is positioned in the bottom of over?ow tank
51. Depending on the position of valve 57, pump 56 will
pump liquid from over?ow tank 51 into examination
tank 50 so that the level of the liquid, degassed water in
a preferred embodiment, within tank 50 will be main
tained at the maximum level so that the underarm areas
of a patient can be examined to determine if breast can
cer has spread to this part of a patient’s body; or to drain
spigot 58 to empty both examination tank 50 and over
?ow tank 51. The lower portion of over?ow tank 51
can be covered with insulation 59 to minimize the loss
of heat from liquid contained therein. A patient 60 lies
prone on the upper surface of table 53 with her breasts
61 freely ?oating in a liquid which substantially ?lls
examination tank 50. In the preferred embodiment the
4,233,988
7
liquid is water which is maintained substantially at a
temperature which is not uncomfortable to the patient,
a temperature in the range of 37° C., for example. The
bene?ts of having the patient’s breasts immersed in
water in this manner are that there is no distortion ofthe
outer or internal structures of the breasts and the liquid
?lling tank 50 provides a good coupling medium for
ultrasonic sound from the transducers 20 of scanners 40,
42 to the tissue to be visualized and, equally as well, a -
good medium for the re?ected signals, or echoes, from
the tissue scanned to the transducer 20 which of course
enhances the resolution of the images of the tissue, or
their visualization.
The location of examination tank 50 within over?ow
tank 51 and providing drainage opening 55 in the exami
nation table 53 so that liquid from examination tank 50
can ?ow into over?ow tank 51 has solved the prior art
problem of trying to minimize the amount of liquid
escaping from the examination tank while maintaining
the level of the liquid in the tank at the highest possible
level to assure that the examination is as thorough and
complete as possible. The over?ow tank eliminates the
need for water tight seals between the patient and the
top of the examination tank and avoids the loss of sub
stantial quantities of liquid which liquid is expensive
both to heat and to degas.
In FIG. 3 additional details of carriage 48, scanners
40, 42 and arms 44, 46 are illustrated. Bridge, or truss, 62
is provided with substantially planar surfaces 640, b, c, a’
which intersect to form a groove within which a
wedge-shaped portion 66a, b of carriage 48 project. A
plurality of rollers 67a, 67b are mounted in wedges 660,
b, preferably three in each wedge 66a and 66b for a total
of six. Rollers 67 roll on surfaces 64a, b, c, a’ to permit
carriage 48 to move smoothly and with little frictional
drag along bridge 62.
Arms 44, 46 are mounted on a four-member ?ipping,
or orienting mechanism 68, more particularly top mem
ber, or link, 69 which is connected to base member, or
link, 70, the portion of carriage 48 between pivots 71a,
71b by a pair of arms 72, 73. It should be noted that arms
72 and 73 are of substantially equal length. The four
links 69, 70, 72 and 73 are pivotally connected together.
A pinion gear 74 is mounted for rotation about its longi
tudinal axis 75 on a pair of shoulders 76a, 76b on bridge
62. Only shoulder 76b is seen in FIG. 3. An orienting
gear 77 is ?xedly secured to top member 69 and its
dimensions are chosen so that the teeth of gear 77 mesh
with the teeth of pinion gear 74 so that when pinion
gear 74 rotates about its axis of rotation 75, the orienta
tion of top member 69 changes in a predetermined man
ner.
The relationship between the lengths of arms 72, 73
which in the preferred embodiment are equal and the
length of top member 69 and base link 70 as well as the
axis of rotation 75 of pinion gear 74 are chosen so that
over a substantial angle of movement of top link 69, 45°
in the preferred embodiment, or :22 %° on either side
of vertical, the distance between the center 78 of gear 77
and the axis of rotation 75 of pinion gear 74 is substan
tially constant. Thus the locus of the point of contact
between orienting gear 77 and pinion gear 74 coincides
with the perimeter of pinion gear 74 as top member 69
moves through an angle of up to 45°. ,
Arms 44, 46 are in the preferred embodiment substan
tially of the same length. At the ends of arms 44, 46
scanner holders, or mounts, 78, 80 removably secure the
body portions 81, 82 of scanners 40, 42 to arms 44, 46.

necting the axes of rotation 88, 90 of scanners 40, 42
passes through the center of gear 78 and is at an angle a
with respect to vertical axis 92 with a equaling 22? in
the preferred embodiment. Adjustable stop 93 is set to
limit a to 22%". counterclockwise rotation of pinion
gear 74 will cause flipping mechanism 68 to cause top
member 69 to be reoriented so that perpendicular bisec
tor 91 will be on the right-hand side of vertical axis 92.
Adjustable stop 94 is positioned so that when the bot
tom surface of arm 44 engages stop 94, a will have a
value of -22§° in the preferred embodiment.
A channel 95 is formed in the upper surface ofbridge
62. Small diameter ?exible cables 96, 97 are attached to
carriage 48 by conventional means to cause carriage 48
to slide on, or more relative ‘to, bridge 62 as will be
explained below.
FIG. 4 is a cross-section of scanner 42. Within the
body portion 82 is located motor 18b which, in a pre
ferred embodiment, is a 24 volt synchronous AC motor
that rotates at 3600 rpm. Motor 18b is connected to
drive shaft 98 by reduction gears 100, which in the
preferred embodiment reduces the rpms of shaft 98 to
100 rpm. As can be best seen in FIG. 5 scanning head 86
has three wide apertured focused ultrasonic transducers
20a, b and c which are uniformly distributed, or posi
tioned, around the perimeter of scanning head 86 with
the angle B between the axes of the radiation patterns,
or beams, of focused ultrasonic energy produced by
transducers 20a, b, c being 120'’ in the preferred embodi
ment, substantially normal to the axis of rotation 90 of
scanning head 86. Scanning head 86 is mounted on shaft
98 so that the axis of rotation of shaft 98 coincides with
axis 90 with the result that the radiation patterns of
transducers 200, b, c, substantially lie in a plane perpen
dicular to axis 90. To provide an electrical connection
between the transducers 200, b, c of scanning head 86,
and transmitter/receiver 24, a slip ring assembly 230 is
provided. Since scanner 42 is operated while immersed
in a liquid such as water great care is taken to assure that
the interior of housing 82 and scanning head 86 are
constructed to prevent the entrance of moisture into the
interior of housing 82 and of scanning head 86 particu
larly around the bearings and where the wires connect
ing scanner 42 with the rest of the system 10 enter into
body or housing 82. In addition a compressed air line is
connected to housing 82 so that air at a pressure greater
than that of the liquid surrounding housing 82 is present
within housing 82.
Since the safety of the patient is paramount, the de
sign of the scanner subsystem is ultraconservative with
respect to minimizing the risk of electrical short circuits
occurring in any portion of the system and particularly
so with respect to the scanning subsystem. To further
reduce the hazard, low voltages are used to supply
power to subsystems located in examination tank 50
such as 24 volts AC is used to power motors 18a, b. The
wires which carry electrical power to motor 18b and
the wires that connect the transducers 20 to transmit
ter/receiver 24 and the wires for the necessary control
signals needed by the scanners 40, 42 or other compo
nents of system 10 and the compressed air lines are
attached or are connected to the arms, such as arm 46
for scanner 42 and then to the carriage 48 and from
4,233,988
9
carriage 48 they then proceed outside of examination
tank 50.
In FIG. .6 slip ring assemblies 23a of scanner 42 and
23b of scanner 40 are schematically illustrated. Assem
bly 23a has a circular disc 102a on which are formed
three conductive rings, inner ring 103a, transducer ring
104a and outer ring 105a. Inner ring 103a is continuous
and is at ground potential. Outer or ?duciary ring 105a
has a ?ducial mark 106a which is at ground potential in
the preferred embodiment. The balance of outer ring
105a is ?oating; i.e. electrically isolated. Transducer
ring 104a is divided into three substantially equal sized
segments, or arcs, 1070, b, c. The central angles deter
mined by arcs 107a, b, c are slightly less than 120°. The
center of disc 110a lies on the axis of rotation 90 of
scanning head 86. The wiper arm subassembly 108a,
which is also illustrated schematically in FIG. 4, is
mounted on body portion 82 of scanner 42 so that the
wiper arms, or contacts, 109a, b, c“ride on or contact
rings 103a, 104a, 105a. The direction‘ of rotation of
scanning head 86 is the direction of arrow 110a, or
clockwise.
Slip ring assembly 23b is similar to vassembly 23a. It ,
has a disc l02b on which are formed three conductive
rings 103b, 104b, 105b. Inner ring 103b is at ground
potential. Fiduciary ring 105b has a ?ducial mark 106b
at ground potential. Transducer ring 104b is divided
into three substantially equal sized segments, or arcs,
107d, e, f with the central angles determined by arcs
107d, e,fbeing slightly less than 120°. The center ofdisc
l02b lies on the axis of rotation 88 of scanning head 84.
The wiper arm subassembly 10812 is substantially identi
cal to that of 108a. The direction of rotation ofscanning
head 84 is the direction of arrow 110b.
- Conductive arcs 107a, b, c of slip ring assembly 23a
are connected to transducers 20a, b, c, respectively, and
conductive arcs 107d, e, fare connected to transducers
20d, e, f respectively. The center conductor, or wiper,
10911 and 109e of wiper arm subassemblies 108a, b are
connected to transmitter/receiver 24 by conductors
that run down arms 44, 46 to carriage 48 and from
carriage 48 along the sides of examination tank 50 until
they pass out of the top of tank 50,- for example. Wiper
arms 109a, 109d are connected to control processor 26,
and wiper arms 109e, 109f are connected to electrical
ground by wires which are run substantially parallel to
the wires connecting wiper arms 109b, 109e to transmit
ter/receiver 24 at least until they leave tank 50.
In FIG. 6 the ?ducial marks 106a, 106b are positioned
on ?duciary rings 105a, 105b so that they have a prede
termined angular position with respect to the arcs 107 of
transducer rings 104a, 1041) which arcs are electrically
isolated from one another. Having ?duciary marks
1060, 106b with a known relationship to the arcs 107 of
transducer rings 1040, 104b makes it possible to have
overlapping sector scans be conducted by the transduc
ers of each scanner head 84, 86 while still making cer
tain that only one transducer 20 is connected to trans
mitter/receiver 24 at any one time and so that one trans
ducer 20 is connected to transmitter/receiver 24 sub
stantially at all times during each revolution of scanner
heads 84, 86 as will be explained later.
Referring to FIG. 7 transport mechanism 14 has a
pair of rails 114, 116 which are ?xedly mounted in ex
amination tank 50. Rails 114, 116 are parallel to each
other and are spaced apart a ?xed distance and de?ne,
or lie in, a plane that is substantially horizontal. Bridge,
or truss, 62 is mounted on rails 114, 116 so that bridge 62
5
20
25
40
45
60
65
10
can move on rails 114, 116 parallel to them and so that
the longitudinal axis 118 ofbridge 62 is perpendicular to
rails 114, 116. Carriage 48 is mounted on bridge 62 for
movement parallel to longitudinal axis 118 ofbridge 62.
Only an outline of carriage 48 is illustrated in FIG. 7
since carriage 48 was illustrated in greater detail on
FIG. 3 and has been described above. In the preferred
embodiment bridge 62 and rails 114, 116 are provided
with cooperating wedge shaped surfaces similar to the
surfaces of bridge 62 and carriage 48 as well as rollers
which are not illustrated which permit carriage bridge
62 to move easily on rails 114, 116.
Four bridge pulleys 120a, b, c, d are mounted on
bridge 62, two substantially at each end of the bridge
and the pulleys are so mounted that they are spaced
equidistantly from the longitudinal axis 128 of truss 62.
Four rail pulleys 1220, b, c, d are mounted on rails 114,
116 with one pulley being positioned at each end of
each rail. Pulleys 120, 122 are, in the preferred embodi
ment, mounted so that their axes of rotation are parallel
to each other and perpendicular to the plane of the rails
114, 116. To avoid having cables 96, 97 which are
- placed around pulleys 120, 122 from coming into
contact with bridge 62 or carriage 48, or both, translat
ing, or power pulleys, 124a, b, c, d are mounted one at
each end of rails 114, 116. The axes of rotation of pul
leys. 124 are parallel to each other and to the plane of
rails 114, 116. The function of translating pulleys 124 -
are to lower the portion of the cables 96, 97 which run
diagonally from the corners of the rails so that they pass
under bridge 62. Pulleys 124 can also be used to apply
power to move bridge 62 and carriage 48. One way of
doing this is by motors 1260, b which can be conven
tional variable speed reversible dc servo motors.
One end of cable 96 is fastened securely to carriage
48. Cable 96 is then placed around pulleys 120a, 124a,
122a, 122d, 124d, 120d and its other end is secured to
carriage 48 by a coil spring 127 to maintain tension on
cable 96. Similarly cable 97, one end of which is secured
to carriage 48, is placed around pulleys 120b, 124b,
122b, 122c, 124c, 1200 and its other end is attached by
coil spring 127 to carriage 48. The function of coil
spring 127 is to maintain the proper tension on cables 96
and 97.
FIG. 8 and 9 illustrate schematically the theory of
operation of transport mechanism 14. Translating pul
leys 124 which are provided to avoid problems due to
the thickness of the rails, truss and carriage are omitted
to simplify the illustration. In FIG. 8 if power is applied
to cables 96, 97 to cause pulleys 122a, 122b, which in
FIG. 8 are the equivalent of the pulleys 122a, 122b and
translating pulleys 1240, 124b, to rotate in opposite
directions and if the direction of rotation is in the direc
tion of the solid arrows, carriage 48 will move in the
direction of the solid arrow toward rail 116. If pulleys
122a, b rotate in opposite directions as shown by the
dashed line arrows of FIG. 8, carriage 48 will move in
the direction of the dashed arrow toward rail 114.
FIG. 9 illustrates what happens if cables 96, 97 are
driven to cause pulleys 122a, b to rotate in the same
direction. If in the direction of the solid arrows then
bridge 62 will move to the right as indicated byvthe solid
arrows and if pulleys 122a, b rotate in the direction of
thedashed line arrows, then bridge 62 will move to the
left in the direction of the dashed arrows.
The motors which provide power to cables 96, 97, if
they cause cables 96, 97 to move at the same speed, will
cause either carriage 48 or bridge 62 to move depending
4,233,988
11
upon the direction of movement of the cables but not
both. If the speeds ofcables 96, 97 are not the same, then
both the carriage 48 and bridge 62 will move.
Transport mechanism 14 permits carriage 48 to be
moved to any position substantially within the rectan
gular area 128 which is seen in FIG. 7, which area lies
within lines tangent to the rail pulleys 122. Instead of
providing power to the ?exible cables 96, 97 by motors
126a, b driving pulleys 1240, b, power could be pro- -
vided by ?exible drive cables placed around drive pul
leys 130a, b which are directly connected to translating
pulleys 124a, d in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 7
which drive cables may be powered by motors located
outside of examination tank 50. Other ways of provid
ing the power to the cables 96, 97 are possible and fall
within the scope of this invention.
Orienting mechanism 68 of transport mechanism 14
orients the scanners 40, 42 so that they are optimally
positioned with respect to a patient’s breast to be
scanned; i.e., so that the beams of acoustic energy pro
duced by the ultrasonic transducers are as nearly per
pendicular to the sides of the breast being scanned as
possible. As described above, rotating pinion gear 74
will cause top member 69 of the four link ?ipping mech
anism 69 to change the angle of link 69 with respect to
vertical. To cause pinion gear 74 to rotate, track 114 is
provided with a rack 132 substantially in the center of
track 114 as illustrated schematically in FIG. 7. Refer
ring to FIG. 10, pinion gear 74 has one end extended so
that it projects beyond shoulder 760 which is mounted
substantially at one end of bridge 62. Gear 134 is
mounted on pinion gear 74 by a conventional slip clutch
136 so that the teeth of gear 134 will mesh with the teeth
on rack 132. Thus as bridge 62 moves from right to left,
as seen in FIG. 7, driving gear 134 will be caused to
rotate in a counterclockwise direction which causes link
69 to change its orientation with the result that scanner
40 would be lower and scanner 42 will be higher. Mov
ing bridge 62 from left to right would cause the ?ipping
mechanism 68 to position the scanners as illustrated in
FIG. 3. Since shaft 74 runs the full length of bridge 62,
?ipping mechanism 68 will work independently of the
position of carriage 48 on bridge 62. Slip clutch 136 is
provided so that if scanners 40, 42 are repositioned by
hand, for example, so that arm 44 is in contact with
adjustable stop 94 and bridge 62 is moved from right to
left as described above, driving gear 134 will rotate, but
the torque applied to pinion gear 74 will be sufficiently
low as to not damage ?ipping mechanism 68.
Advantages of ?ipping mechanism 68 are that it pro
vides an effective gear reduction, it takes only a short
length of rack 132 to reorien't the scanners. The orienta
tion of the scanners 40, 42 is stable when drive gear 134
is no longer in contact with rack 132 since the center of
gravity of the scanners has to be raised signi?cantly to
change their orientation. In addition, the four link ?ip
ping mechanism provides an essentially stable point for
attaching the electrical conductors and compressed air
lines to carriage 48 to minimize the length of such lines
and conductors.
To conduct an ultrasonic examination of a patient’s
breasts, or more speci?cally to produce a series of cross
sectional images of the tissue of each breast, the patient
60 lies prone on examination table 53 with her breasts 61
freely ?oating in the liquid with which examination
tank 50 is ?lled, degassed water in the preferred exam
ple. The side walls of tank 50 as well as those of over
?ow tank 51, are transparent, or are provided with
25
40
45
65
12
windows, so that the operator can properly position
carriage 48 relative to the patient. Referring to FIG. 11
scanners 40, 42 are mounted on arms 44, 46 which in
turn are mounted on carriage 48 of transport mechanism
14. In scanning the patient’s left breast, for.example,
scanner 42 which is between the breasts is lower than
scanner 40. The operator positions the carriage 48 so
that the perpendicular bisector 91 substantially passes
through the nipple ofthe patient and is also substantially
perpendicular to the patient’s rib cage 140. The scan
ning heads 84, 86 are positioned as illustrated in FIG. 11
so that the centerlines 142, 144 of the sector scans con
ducted by scanning heads 84, 86 intersect perpendicular
bisector 91 at a point substantially directly behind the
nipple and between the nipple and the rib cage 140.
Carriage 48 is positioned on bridge 62 so that ifscanning
starts at the inferior border of the breast the carriage 48
will be moved along bridge 62 toward rail116 at a
constant speed until the superior border of the breast is
scanned. Controls of the movement of carriage 48 is by
controlling servo motors 16. Under overall control of
the operator, control processor 26 in response to posi
tion information received from servo motors 16 causes
a dc voltage to be supplied to the motors which is a
function of the desired velocity of motors 16. Servo
motors 16 control the direction of movement of ?exible
cables 96, 97 as described above and the speed of move
ment is of course determined by the speed at which the
cables are driven.
When scanning subsystem 12 is properly positioned,
motors 18a, 18b driving the scanning heads 84, 86 are
energized. As described above, the motors 18a, 18b for
scanners 40, 42 are, in the preferred embodiment, 3600
rpm synchronous motors which are geared down to
rotate scanning heads 84, 86 at 100 rpm each. At this
angular velocity heads 84, 86 produce no cavitation or
extraneous noise which would interfere with the opera
tion of transducers 20 or have an- adverse effect on the
resolution of the images produced. Transmitter/
receiver 24 is energized. To produce the overlapping
sector scan illustrated in FIG. 11 while avoiding having
more than one transducer 20 of either scanning head 84,
86 connected to transmitter/receiver 24 at the same
time, it is necessary to maintain the phase angle 7 be
tween the two scanning heads 84, 86 at the correct
' valuefor 7 which equals the central angle of one of the
conductive arcs 107 during which the ultrasonic trans
ducers connected to the arc is energized, i.e., substan
tially 60° plus 45'‘ so that the angle ‘)1 is 105° in the pre
ferred embodiment.
Fiducial marks 106a. 106b are used to determine or
measure 7 and are positioned so that they produce a
signal or pulse each time the wiper arms 109a, 109d
contact ?ducial marks 106a, 106b. Knowing the angular
velocity of scanning heads 84, 86, the angle 7 is then a
function of the difference in time At between wiper
109a contacting ?ducial mark 106a and wiper 109d
contacting ?ducial mark 106b, for example. Computer
controller 26 can measure At and if At does not have the
right value, controller 26 causes one or the other of
motors 18a, 18b to slow down momentarily, for exam
ple. One way of doing this would be to use a variable
frequency oscillator to provide the power to motors
18a, 18b and by changing the frequency of the alternat
ing current applied to one of the motors to produce the
change necessary to obtain the desired phase angle 7.
Another way is to momentarily interrupt the power
supplied to one ofthe motors 180 or b by use of conven-v
4,233,988
13
tional solid state relays 22. Obviously motors 18a and
18b could also be variable speed dc motors so that the
speed of one motor could be varied enough to produce
the desired phase angle 'y.
Once the scanning heads 84, 86 are properly synchro
nized with the proper phase angle )1, the scanning com
mences and the carriage 48 is caused to move by apply
ing power to the ?exible cables 96, 97 to cause them to
move at controlled velocities. The velocity of the car
riage 48'or bridge 62 is chosen so that it advances at a
rate of from 1 to 2 millimeters per revolution of scan
ning head 84, for example. During each revolution of
each scanning head 84, 86 each of the transducers 20a-f
is connected to transmitter/receiver 24. Sectors 146,
148 scanned by the scanning heads 84, 86 respectively as
illustrated in FIG. 11 are divided into three‘contiguous
zones A, B, C of sector 148 and zones D, E, F of sector
146. The widths, or depths, of the sectors substantially
correspond to the focal range of the transducer con
ducting the scan of the zone with some overlap at the
common boundaries; for example the scan of zone A of
sector 148 may be conducted by transducer 20a of scan
ning head 86. Similarly the scanning of different zones .
of each sector by different transducer 20 results in sec
tor scans of higher resolution which sector scans are
overlapped in the area of greatest interest with respect
to the detection of tissue abnormalities in the breast.
The echoes received by each transducer 20a-f are
converted by signal processor 28 from A mode to ultra
sonic video signals which are applied to scan converter
30 as described above. The scan converter 30 converts
the signals applied to it into video signals suitable for
display on TV monitor 34 and for recording by a video
recorder 36. The operator controls how the images
produced from the echoes will be displayed. For exam
ple, the signals from each zone of each sector could be
separately displayed. The signals from each scanning
head can be displayed together to provide a sector scan
or the signals can be combined to produce a composite
image. Best resolution is obtained when the images of
all zones of both sectors are combined to produce an
overlapped, or composite, image or visualization. Reso
lution is also improved by operating the scan converter
30 in an integrating mode.
After carriage 48 is moved from the inferior to the
superior border of the patient’s left breast for example,
the carriage is then moved by causing the bridge 62 to
move until the scanning head 40 is between the breasts
of the patient. As bridge 62 moves driving gear 134 will
engage rack 132 mounted on rail 114 and rotate. Rota
tion of pinion gear 74 in a counterclockwise direction as
viewed in FIG. 3 will change the orientation of top
member 69 so that arm 44 engages adjustable stop 94.
Once arm 44 engages stop 94, slip clutch 136 permits
drive gear 134 to continue to rotate as long as it engages
rack 132 without applying excessive torque to pinion
gear 74. '
The operator controls the position of bridge 62 so
that the perpendicular bisector 91 will pass through the
nipple of the patient’s right breast, for example, and be
substantially perpendicular to the patient’s rib cage 140.
It has been noted that lines through the nipples of each
breast perpendicular to the rib cage, which lines are also
the axes of symmetry of the breast, diverge generally at
an angle of 45° to one another. To properly position
scanners 40, 42 for patient’s whose breasts diverge at
substantially different angles, it is possible to adjust the
angle that the perpendicular bisector 91 makes with
15
20
25
30
45
60
65
14
vertical by changing the length of adjustable stops 93,
94.
Once bridge 62 is positioned so that the perpendicular
bisector 91 will pass through the nipple of the patient’s
right breast and again be substantially perpendicular to
the patient’s rib cage 140 behind the second breast,‘
carriage 48 is moved until it is at the inferior border of
the breast. Then carriage 48 is caused to move toward
the superior border at a constant rate of l to 12 millime
ters per revolution of the scanning heads. A scan of the
second breast is conducted in substantially the same
way as the ?rst.
In a preferred embodiment control processor 26 is a
model 6502 made by the MOS Technology Company,
scan converter 30 is a model 639H made by the Hughes
Aircraft Company, TV-display or monitor 34 is a model
VF02 made by the Conrac Company, video recorder 36
is a model CR606OU made by the JVC Company and
keyboard 38 is a model L1648 made by the Key-Tronic
Company.
From the foregoing it is believed obvious that this
invention provides an improved high resolution rotat
ing head ultrasonic scanner which is particularly useful
in a scanning subsystem for an ultrasonic breast scanner
that provides visualizations of breast tissue of signi?
cantly improved resolution, which requires little time to
conduct an examination, does not require a highly ‘
skilled operator and conducts the examination with the
minimum of discomfort to the patient so that many
patients can be examined to increase the probability of
the early detection ofbreast carcinoma or precancerous
conditions and thus to minimize the death rate from
cancer of the breast.
