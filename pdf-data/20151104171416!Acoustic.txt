In this document, we will explain some basis of the acoustic theory to understand the propagation
of acoustic waves and the echographic process.
1 Propagation of acoustic waves
In this section, we will define the differents type of acoustic waves and some basic equations and
properties of the propagation of acoustic waves.
1.1 Wave types
An acoustic wave is a perturbation of the local state without displacement of the global state. Acoustic
waves are periodic, their spatial periodicity is given by the wavelength λ. Consider a medium at rest
such as on Fig. 1, where the particles are represented by the dots. Such a periodic structure represent
a metal for examples. When an acoustic wave propagate in this medium, the particles will have a
local displacement.
Figure 1: Medium at rest.
Their is two types of acoustic waves, the longitudinal waves (Fig. 2) also named P waves and
the transverse waves (Fig. 3) also named SH or SV waves. The longitudinal waves are compressional
waves, the direction of the displacement of the particles is the same than the direction of propagation
of the wave. The transverse waves are shear waves, the direction of displacement is then perpendicular
to the direction of propagation of the wave. In a fluid, such as the water, only longitudinal waves can
propagate. In the human body, the shear modulus is very small, it can be considered as a fluid, and
so only longitudinal waves will be generated.

1.2 Mathematical formulation
In acoustic, a fluid medium is describe by two mecanical parameters: the mass density ρ and the bulk
modulus κ. The bulk modulus relate the change of volume of a medium to the isostatic pressure apply
on it. The velocity of the acoustic wave c is:
c =
r
κ
ρ
, (1)
for example, for the water we have: ρ = 1000 kg.m−3
, κ = 2.19 MPa and c = 1480 m.s−1.
The mathematical formulation is obtained by solving the Helmholtz equation, for exemple, the
acoustic pressure p (x, t) can be expressed as:
p (x, t) =

A+
ei kx
+A−
e− i kx

e− i ωt
, (2)
A+ ei kx is a wave of amplitude A+, propagating toward the positive x, A− e− i kx is a wave of amplitude
A−, propagating toward the negative x. k =
ω
c
is the wavenumber, ω = 2πf the angular pulsation
and f the frequency.
When we make an echographic image, we are intresting only on the intensity of the wave:
I =
1
2
< [p (x, t) v∗
(x, t)] , (3)
where v (x, t) is the velocity of the particle, and x∗ represent the complex conjugate of x. It can be
shown with the Euler’s equation that the intensity is directly proportional to the square modulus of
the pressure.
1.3 Refraction and diffusion of acoustic waves
When an acoustic wave passes from a medium (0) to a second medium (1), a part of the wave is
reflected an the over part is transmitted through the interface. When the interface is flat in the point
of view of the wave, we have refraction (it is a quasi one dimensional problem, because the wave is
reflected only on only one direction of the space). When the wave see the curvature of the interface,
the wave is scattered on all the directions of the space, we talk then about diffusion.
1.3.1 Refraction of a wave
We consider a incident wave φinc normal to an interface, the reflected φR = Rφinc and the transmitted
φT = Tφinc waves are also normal to the interface (Fig. 4). R and T represent respectively the reflexion

and transmission coefficient. By solving this problem, we show that:
R =
Z2 − Z1
Z2 + Z1
(4)
where Zi = ρici is the acoustic impedance of the medium i.
If we consider, for example the reflection of a wave at an interface between water (ρ0 = 1000 kg.m−3
,
c0 = 1480 m.s−1) and a muscle (ρ1 = 1070 kg.m−3
, c1 = 1590 m.s−1), the the reflection coefficient is
equal to 69.10−3, so only 7% of the pressure is reflected. If we know consider an interface between wa-
ter and bone (ρ1 = 2175 kg.m−3
, c1 = 4000 m.s−1), then nearly 70% of the incident wave is reflected.
The echos due to bones are much more higher than the ones due to the muscles.
1.3.2 Scattering of a wave
Even if an object is very small in front of a wave, it always scattered the wave (Fig. 5). It is much
more complicated to determine the scattered wave than a reflected such as in sec. 1.3.1.

The diffused wave go in every direction of the space, it lead that its amplitude decreases with the
distance from the object.
1.4 Attenuative media
The human body is an attenuative media, this mean that the amplitude of a wave propagating in such
medium decrease along its direction of propagation. Mathematically, the propagation of waves in this
kind of medium is written as:
p (x, t) =

A+
ei kx
e−αx
+A−
e− i kx
eαx

e− i ωt
. (5)
The difference between the propagation of a wave between a non-attenuative and an attenuative
medium is present on Fig. 6. So when we do acoustic imaging in the human body, we must gradually
amplify the received signal if we want to convert correctly the analogical signal into a digital signal,
because if the amplitude of the signal is smaller the precision of the ADC, we can’t measure it (see
appendix A). Classically, we do Time Gain Compensation (TGC) on the receive signal in order to
keep a convenient amplitude of the receive signal. An example of this kind of treatment is presented
on Fig. 7, it’s apply to the attenuated signal on the right side of Fig. 6.

3 Signal Processing
In this section we introduce the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and present a basic signal processing
to improve an echographic signal.
3.1 Fast Fourier Transform
The Fourier Transform is a transformation that express a function of a given dimension as a function
of another dimension. Classically, a time dependent signal is expressed as a function of the frequencies.
In acoustic we also apply Fourier transform to a space signal, so the transform is a function of the
wavelength. The Fourier Transform S of a real signal s is complex and < (S) is an even function and
= (S) is odd.
The FFT is an algorithm that calculate the Fourier Transform of a signal very fast, the number
of point the signal must be a power of 2. The FFT of a signal is periodic function with a periodicity
equal to the frequency sampling of the initial signal. Classically, the FFT algorithm return the Fourier
Transform for the positive frequencies. Due to the periodicity of the FFT, the second half of the signal
is the negative frequency part.
Consider a time signal sample at frequency fe = 640 MHz composed of N=1024 points (Fig. 8).
If you keep only the positive frequencies, the frequency vector corresponding to the FFT go from 0 to
fe
N − 1
N
. On octave its given by linspace(0,fe*(N-1)/N,N). The FFT of the time signal keeping the
positive frequencies is presented on Fig. 9.
If one want to filter the signal, it is more convenient to consider the negative frequencies, because
if you to filter the a signal between x and y MHz, you must put to 0 all frequencies except the points
between x and y MHz and also the points between -x and -y MHz. In this case, the frequency vector
is given by linspace(-fe/2*(N-1)/Nfe/2,N) and you must put the second half of the FFT signal at the
beginning. To do that you must create a new vector of the same size than the FFT signal, and doing
fox example: S2(1:N/2-1)=S(N/2+2:end) and S2(N/2:end)=S(1:N/2+1). Then you obtain the signal
presented on Fig. 10.
The real and imaginary part of the FFT presented on Fig. 9 and 10 are divided by their maximum
amplitude to have readable graphics.
If one want to know the central frequency of transducer, you must take the modulus of the FFT of
an echo of the transducer. The central frequency is the frequency where the modulus has the higher
value.

3.2 Hilbert transform
The Hilbert transform is useful for signal processing in echographic imaging, because with this trans-
formation we can access to the envelop of a given signal. The Hilbert transform can be determine
easily with the FFT. Indeed, if you calculate the FFT of a signal and put all the negative frequencies
to 0 and do an IFFT (Inverse Fast Fourier Transform), then you have the Hilbert transform of the
signal. By doing this to the signal presented in Fig. 8, we obtain the transform signal presented on
Fig. 11.

3.3 Basic echographic signal processing
The most basic signal processing for echographic imaging is to filter the signal and extract the envelop
of the filtered signal. So you make an FFT of the signal measured by the transducer and you filter ±
2 MHz around the central frequency of the transducer for example, lets say between 5.5 and 9.5 MHz
for a transducer centered at 7.5 MHz. You can keep the positive frequency, so you put all frequency
smaller than 5.5 and higher than 9.5 MHz to 0. By doing this you apply a square window on the
signal, you can also apply an Hamming, Hanning or Blackmann window. The negative frequency are
also put to 0 with this method so if you make an IFFT, you apply a Hilbert transform to the filtered
signal. By taking the modulus so we access to the envelop of the filtered signal.
Now we have to define the pixels of the image. For example we can say that a pixel as the same
length that the wavelength λ of the acoustic wave, λ =
c
f
(c = 1500 m.s−1). The time t nedeed
to travelled a distance d is t =
2d
c
(2 because the wave travelled back and forth) so if d = λ then
t = 26.7µs. At 640 MHz, it correspond to 171 time points. The value of pixel is then define by
integrated the signal on 171 points. An echographic image show the value of the acoustic power in
dB, so to obtain this you just have to plot 20 log (s). Where s is the envelop of the filtered signal
integrated on the adequate number of time points.

A ADC
In this appendix, we make a quick introduction to Analogical Digital Converter. This component is
one of the most important in an echographic probe, so it is necessary to understand how does it work.
As its name suggest, an ADC convert the algebrical value of the tension of a signal to a digital
signal. To remember, a digital signal is a binary signal, the 0 correspond to 0 V, the low value and
1 correspond correspond to high value (5 V for example). In a computer or smartphone, all the
treatment are made in digital form, so it is necessary to convert the analogical signal measured on the
transducer to a digital signal. An ADC is characterized by its sampling rate expressed in sampling
per second (Sps) and its precision n. The sampling rate define the number of time it convert a signal
per second. The precision define on how many bites the digital number is written, so the ADC sample
the signal on 2n values.
An ADC is supply with a given continuous current Vcc. So the ADC sampling of the analogical
are 2n value equally space between −Vcc (or 0V) and +Vcc. The precision p of the ADC is then:
p =
2Vcc
2n − 1
. (6)
So if we have Vcc = 5 V on a 8 bites ADC (n = 8), then the precision is then 39.2 mV. Now consider
than the output k of the ADC is an unsigned integer (this mean that the output is 0 to 255) then the
voltage Vm of the analogical signal is:
Vm = −Vcc + kp, (7)
so if k = 23 then the analogical signal is -4.1 V high.
