Abstract—A fully hardware-based real-time digital wide-
band quadrature demodulation processor based on the Hilbert
transform is proposed to process ultrasound radio frequency
signals. The presented architecture combines 2 finite impulse
response (FIR) filters to process in-phase and quadrature sig-
nals and includes a piecewise linear approximation architecture
that performs the required square root operations. The pro-
posed implementation enables flexibility to support different
transducers with its ability to load on-the-fly different FIR
filter coefficient sets. The complexity and accuracy of the de-
modulator processor are analyzed with simulated RF data; a
normalized residual sum-of-squares cost function is used for
comparison with the Matlab Hilbert function. Three imple-
mentations are integrated into a hand-held ultrasound sys-
tem for experimental accuracy and performance evaluation.
Real-time images were acquired from a reference phantom,
demonstrating the feasibility of using the presented architec-
ture to perform real-time digital quadrature demodulation of
ultrasonic signal echoes. Experimental results show that the
implementation, using only 2942 slices and 3 dedicated digi-
tal multipliers of a low-cost and low-power field-programmable
gate array (FPGA) is accurate relative to a comparable soft-
ware-based system; axial and lateral resolution of 1 mm and
2 mm, respectively, were obtained with a 12-mm piezoelectric
transducer without postprocessing. Because the processing and
sampling rates are the same, high-frequency ultrasound sig-
nals can be processed as well. For a 15-frame-per-second dis-
play, the hand-held ultrasonic imaging-processing core (FPGA,
memory) requires only 45 mW (dynamic) when using a 5-MHz
single-element piezoelectric transducer.
I. Introduction
Since its inception, medical ultrasound imaging has
improved greatly and is now a well-established diag-
nostic tool widely used in clinical applications [1]. Over
the last several decades, research efforts have sought to
reduce the size of devices supporting this technology to
enable the deployment of low-power, low-cost, real-time,
hand-held imaging systems [2]–[4]. Further miniaturiza-
tion of these devices will motivate the expansion of nu-
merous ultrasound imaging applications into the areas of
emergency, itinerant, and veterinary medicine, to name a
few. Furthermore, the low-cost aspect of miniaturization
will facilitate the emergence of this technology in develop-
ing countries.
Today, to process ultrasound signals, most commercial-
ly available systems are software-based and hence built
around conventional microprocessors or digital signal
processors [2], [5]. Currently, the enormous advantages in
flexibility offered by software and the availability of a wide
selection of embedded or soft-core processors have sup-
ported this trend. However, software-based systems are
implemented with powerful generic processor architecture,
and in addition to their inconvenient physical dimensions,
they require high power budgets [6]. Consequently, hard-
ware/software partitioning of the ultrasound preprocess-
ing architecture (Fig. 1) appears as a potential solution.
Therefore, this paper presents the implementation of a
flexible, fully hardware-based digital wideband quadrature
demodulation processor into a real-time hand-held ultra-
sound medical imaging device.
A. Hardware/Software Partitioning
Due to its complexity, hardware-based digital beam-
former implementation has demonstrated proven benefits
[2], [7], [8]. However, RF demodulation and digital scan
converter algorithms are more suitable for software imple-
mentation because of their lower computational complex-
ity [9]–[11]. Nevertheless, the advantages of some of the
new hardware-based implementations have been docu-
mented in the literature [3], [12]–[16]. In preprocessing
units, however, the hardware/software boundary is still at
an early stage (Fig. 1). The proposed solution presents a
complete hardware-based digital quadrature demodulator
that pushes this boundary. Thus, the generic processor
would be dedicated to user applications or postprocessing,
with lower size and power requirements than a similar
software-based system.
B. Digital Quadrature Demodulation
Because ultrasonic RF signals are broadband [1], 2 con-
ventional methods for wideband quadrature demodulation
can be used: digital mixing and the Hilbert transform
(HT). Although the HT is more efficient than the mixing
method, mixer algorithms are generally preferred over the
HT because, albeit more accurate, the HT is a more com-
plex method [12]. However, for reasons of overall system
efficiency, the proposed solution is based on the Hilbert
method.
The Hilbert transform data processing system can be
built using finite impulse response (FIR) filters, infinite

impulse response (IIR) filters, complex filters, or other
techniques [17]–[20]. Because FIR filter complexity is simi-
lar to that of the IIR filter [17], latency is not critical, and
FIR filters are more stable, FIR filters are used for this
implementation. Furthermore, a hardware-based square
root unit based on a piecewise linear function completes
the proposed demodulator. A field programmable gate ar-
ray (FPGA) implementation of a quadrature demodulator
and its integration into a miniaturized ultrasound imag-
ing system is also proposed. Finally, basic noise impact is
integrated into the solution comparisons.
C. System Platform Architecture
The system platform architecture (see Fig. 2) is based
on a single ultrasound channel composed of a probe, an
analog front-end module, an analog-to-digital converter
(ADC), a digital back-end module, and a user interface
(keyboard and video display). The analog front-end mod-
ule consists of a variable gain amplifier (VGA), a time-
gain compensator (TGC), an ultrasound transmission
block, an echo receiver, and a passive band-pass filter.
The back-end consists of an RF signal demodulator, a
scan converter, a frame buffer, and a system control unit.
All required power supplies are onboard, with a DC input
voltage range of 6  to 15  V. The system is designed to
process acquired RF signals to perform real-time imag-
ing with low power consumption. The digital demodulator
can be implemented in a single FPGA using for input
either digitized echoes from single-element transducers or
the output of a real-time digital beamformer being used
for dynamic focusing. The digital beamforming module
can be designed to employ varying numbers of transducer
elements in several different topologies. The reprogram-
mability, flexibility, and low power characteristics of the
latest FPGAs allow implementing an RF demodulator
capable of advanced signal processing tasks such as gray-
scale compression (see [11], [21]), filtering, and instanta-
neous frequency-shift estimation.
The remainder of this paper consists of a description
in Section II of the hardware-based digital demodulator,
including the mathematical background and circuit ar-
chitecture. Section III presents the demodulator and the
square root architectures. In Section IV, the simulation
and experimental results are presented. Finally, the con-
clusion is given in Section V.
II. FIR Filter-Based HT Quadrature
Demodulator
A. The Hilbert Transform: Mathematical Background
It has been proven that the HT is an efficient algorithm
for processing nonlinear, nonstationary data series such as
ultrasonic RF signals [1], [19], [22], [23]. Because the HT
is a well-known algorithm and has been widely covered
[19], [22]–[25], this section only briefly summarizes the HT
theory as applied to RF demodulation.

The Bedrosian theorem [24] states that, if the Fourier
spectra for a(t) and cos[θ(t)] are nonoverlapping in the fre-
quency space and if the frequency range of the spectrum
for cos[θ(t)] is higher than that for a(t), then the HT for
the product of these 2 functions can be written as

Ultrasonic RF signals follow the Bedrosian theorem
because their frequency spectra is composed of a cen-

Powers demonstrated that, although a real HT is physi-
cally impossible to realize, it is possible to build a Hilbert
transformer that yields a close approximation of the trans-
fer function [25]. Such an approximation is used in this
paper to calculate the HT and is equivalent to 90° out of

B. Quadrature Demodulator Architecture
Fig. 3 presents FIR filter-based HT quadrature de-
modulator architecture designed to process ultrasonic RF
signals. To synchronize the in-phase (I) signal with the
quadrature (Q) signal and to achieve the same bandwidth
windows on both signals, a band-pass FIR filter is used in
parallel with the HT FIR filter.
A conventional FIR filter-based HT quadrature demod-
ulator requires high-order FIR filters due to their large
bandwidth and small bandgap between passband and stop-
band. Rather than using one fixed and large demodulator,
the presented architecture implements a smaller demodu-
lator that can be adapted for each supported transducer
by loading different coefficient sets on the fly. This adapt-
ed approach has been compared with 2 other methods of
building an FIR filter-based HT quadrature demodulator.
The first one is the conventional method that uses a real
coefficient band-pass FIR filter with a unitary gain and
a linear phase of 90°/decade over the entire bandwidth
(0.1π to 0.9π). The second one is the Reilly generic ap-
proach [19] based on complex coefficient FIR filter. The
distinction between Reilly and the proposed implementa-
tion depends on the filter bandwidth. Although Reilly’s
approach results in the same bandwidth as the conven-
tional method, our technique’s bandwidth is narrower and
fitted to the ultrasonic transducer. Cutoff frequency of the
low-pass filter used to build the band-pass filter is set to
half the bandwidth of the ultrasonic transducer (normally
50% of the central frequency) instead of fS/4 (π/2 for
fS = Nyquist frequency) as presented by Reilly. In addi-
tion, the low-pass filter coefficients are modulated by a
complex exponential of frequency equal to the transducer
central frequency instead of fS/4. Compared with conven-
tional and Reilly’s approaches, higher stopband level and
fewer ripples in the passband of the same filter order can
be obtained with our method.

III. Implementation of the Hand-Held
Ultrasound System
To implement a complete system, the digital back-end
demodulator comprising the HT and the proposed square
root architecture is integrated into a miniaturized ultra-
sound-imaging platform (Fig. 2).
A. Digital Back-End: The Hilbert Transform
To reduce the number of shift registers, our design com-
bines the FIR filter shift registers rather than implement-
ing 2 conventional FIR filter architectures. In addition,
with this topology, coefficient precision has no bearing
on shift register bit size, so the multipliers are minimally
complex. The proposed architecture also takes advantage
of linear phase FIR filter symmetry to reduce the number
1657

of multipliers by almost half (n/2+1). Various multiplier
implementations can be used, such as the FPGA-dedicat-
ed multiplier block, look-up-table (LUT)-based multipli-
ers, or canonic signed digit (CSD) multipliers. With the
FPGA-dedicated multipliers and LUT-based multipliers,
different coefficient sets can be used, because they can be
stored in a LUT. Furthermore, LUT and CSD multipli-
ers enable building higher-order FIR filters because they
can offset the limited availability of the FPGA-dedicated
multipliers. To optimize space, dedicated techniques such
as CSD representation should be used [26]–[29]. However,
these implementations may require more than one clock
cycle to perform the multiplication, and they do not offer
the flexibility to modify coefficients on the fly. The FP-
GA-dedicated multiplier block and LUT-based multiplier
implementations are optimized to retain flexibility. Note
that our approach requires this flexibility to support dif-
ferent ultrasonic transducers.
Parks-McClellan’s optimal equiripple FIR filter design
method, also known as the Remez algorithm [30], available
in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA), is the most common
method used to design FIR Hilbert transformers [31] and
was applied to determine the coefficients. The least-square
error minimization algorithm, also available in Matlab,
was also used to determine the band-pass FIR filter coef-
ficients, because the Remez algorithm failed to converge
for some orders of the FIR filter. Because the 2 filters have
a unitary gain and their coefficients are less than one, all
coefficients are multiplied by the same power of 2 scaling
factors to set the coefficient bit resolution. Therefore, the
same quantity of bits as that for the coefficient bit resolu-
tion is truncated at the FIR filter output to remove the
gain factor. The Hilbert transformer architecture for an
even FIR filter of order N is presented in Fig. 4.
The number of bits (p) and the FIR filter order (N)
must be high enough to ensure a good HT approximation.
Unfortunately, hardware complexity increases as either p
or N increases. As explained in [32], it is important to ex-
plore different values for p and N, because it may be more
advantageous to increase p rather than N with regard to
hardware complexity. Note that it is not possible to de-
fine an optimum value for p and N, because the targeted
discrete solution is relative to the required performance,
precision, size, and power consumption compared with
software-based solutions. Consequently, part of the objec-
tive of this paper is to propose p and N values that lead
to a solution that can be effectively implemented with a
single low-cost, low-power FPGA.
To compare the 3 methods, normalized residual sum of
squares (18) was used as a cost function (Fig. 5), where ht
is a compared method and HT, the method used in this
analysis. The latter was the Hilbert function, available in
Matlab. A series of 2000 pseudorandom ultrasounds (τ1)
of 600 samples (τ2) composed of a normalized Gaussian
pulse having a central frequency of 5 MHz with a 50%
bandwidth was used.

As presented in Fig. 6, wideband of 1 to 9 MHz was em-
ployed for conventional (real coefficient FIR filter) and
Reilly (complex coefficient FIR filter) methods, and 2.5
to 7.5 MHz for our adapted method (adapted narrowband
complex coefficient FIR filter).
B. Digital Back-End: Square Root
The proposed square root architecture required by the
HT quadrature demodulator is based on a 2-stage pipe-
lined piecewise linear approximation, which yields a result
at every cycle with a latency of only 2 clock cycles (Fig. 7).
Conventional architecture requires high frequency clock-
ing, because it can process only one bit per clock cycle
[5], needs more latency, and produces a lower throughput
[33]. In addition, the proposed architecture clock runs at
the same rate as the sample clock, enabling the option of
either effective high sample-rate processing or lower clock
frequency, and therefore lower power usage than a con-
ventional implementation. As shown in Fig. 7, an encoder
is used to map the slope and offset of 2 LUTs for each
linear section of the approximation. The maximum error
depends on the segmentation of the square root function:
the greater the segmentation, the smaller the error, but
the greater the amount of hardware required. For this im-
plementation, an error of 1 LSB is reasonable.
C. Digital Back-End: To the Display
Due to the limited display resolution, some ultrasonic
RF signal samples must be grouped during demodulation

ulator architectures use subsampling technique and low-
pass filtering to group received RF samples [3]. In the
proposed architecture, this task is performed by a data
compressor unit that finds a pseudomean of all samples of
the same ultrasonic line located at the same pixel:

This method requires fewer interpolations and improves

IV. Simulation and Experimental Results
Generated RF ultrasonic signals are used as the input
to the VHDL testbench and Matlab simulations, and a
general-purpose multi-tissue ultrasound phantom (Model
040, CIRS, Norfolk, VA) is used as a stable medium to
obtain real ultrasonic images. No image processing or data
interpolations were added. However, as explained later in
this section, a data compressor was implemented to re-
duce data throughput to the frame buffer. It processes
oversampled data on the same ultrasonic line to accommo-
date the 320 × 240 LCD resolution. In addition, a gray-

scale compression unit was implemented to achieve the
intensity calibration and convert the 9-bit demodulated
data to a 6-bit LCD contrast (Fig. 8).
A. Simulation Results
To compare performance in noisy signals processing,
6 different levels of injected Gaussian white noise were
applied to the test series (no noise, and 24, 12, 6, 3, and
0.5 dB SNR). Each of 3 architecture configurations op-
erating on the same generated RF ultrasonic signals in-
jected with different noise levels are presented in Fig. 9.
In addition, Fig. 10 presents some examples of simulated
demodulation for different values of N and p. From this
exploration and a comparison of normalized residual sum
of squares, the architecture obtained with adapted meth-
od, using n = 32 and P = 12, gives relatively good results
for its small size compared with the others. As illustrated
by Fig. 10, higher values of N and p do not seem to worth
the additional hardware complexity.
Because the bandgap between passband and stopband
is wider in our adapted approach, fewer ripples are ob-
tained in the passband compared with the same order FIR
filter in the other tested solutions. Thus, adapted method
scored better on the normalized residual sum of squares
than the other compared methods (Fig. 5). Also, adapted
implementation provides better noise rejection because it
selects only the required bandwidth by having the same
frequency support as the transceiver (Fig. 11), not to men-
tion its higher stopband level. On the other hand, a maxi-
mum error of ± 1 LSB was obtained for the square root
linear approximation with only 16 zones for the 19-bit
input data (Fig. 12).
B. Implementation Results
Table I presents the FPGA utilization summary and
power estimation for the proposed demodulator architec-
ture and the supporting digital system. Due to the limited
number of multiplier blocks in low-cost FPGAs, a maxi-
mum FIR filter order of 16 was achieved. The proposed
digital quadrature demodulator requires 12 multiplier ele-
ments with dedicated FPGA multiplier implementation
and 1150 slices maximum. Higher FIR filter orders of 32
and 64 were successfully implemented with LUT multi-
pliers, requiring 2571 and 2942 slices, respectively. The
sample frequency of the ultrasonic platform is 20 MHz.
The proposed architecture can operate at 80 MHz without
any special configuration of the synthesis tool (ISE 9.2i,
Xilinx, San  Jose, CA) or architectural modification. In
addition, for faster FPGA families, sample data could be
processed at higher rates to demodulate high-frequency
ultrasound RF signals.
C. Experimental Results
The complete hardware implementation of the hand-
held ultrasound system occupies 160 cm2 (Fig. 13). The
entire digital system, including the demodulator and
the scan-converter, is implemented within a single Xil-
inx FPGA (XC3S1500L-FG320). The analog front end
and its required power supplies, on the other hand, are
implemented with off-the-shelf components. An external
memory (PSRAM MT45W2MW16BAFB-708, Micron
Technology Inc., Boise, ID) is used as the video frame
buffer, while the display controller is implemented within
the same FPGA as the other digital circuitry. Finally, the
real-time image is displayed on a 3.6-in. 320 × 240 × 6-bit
color TFT-LCD (LQ036Q1DA01, Sharp Electronics Cor-
poration, Romeoville, IL). It is important to mention that
more that 50% of the area is used by several power sup-
plies because off-the-shelf parts require a large number of
different voltage levels (digital and analog) and could be
reduced with ASIC implementation.
The position references of the transducer (single-ele-
ment 4.75 MHz, 85% bandwidth, focus at 5 cm), gener-
ated by the mechanical scanning probe (GP2000 5 MHz,
Interson Corporation, Pleasanton, CA), are used to pro-
duce a 90° sector image composed of a maximum of 256
real ultrasonic lines. For each new line, a trigger is sent to
the pulser (MD1210 and TC6320, Supertex Inc., Sunny-
vale, CA), which generates a selectable −100 V impulse of

gain range of 48 dB and a large signal (2VPP) bandwidth
of 110 MHz (AD8332, Analog Devices Inc.) are used with
a linear voltage ramp to form a TGC amplifier that pro-
vides precise linear-in-dB scaling of 100dB/V for control
voltages from 40mV to 1V. Before being digitized with a
10-bit ADC (ADC10040, National Semiconductor, Santa
Clara, CA) at 20 MHz, the amplified echoes are filtered
through a passive second order band-pass filter with a
−3 dB cutoff frequency of 1 to 10 MHz. The single chan-
nel analog front-end occupies less than 25 cm2, including
a high-voltage DC-DC converter. Note that attempts to
integrate a similar architecture into a single ASIC are on-
going [4].
Experimental B-mode ultrasound images obtained from
a phantom (Model 040, CIRS) using the proposed archi-
tecture and a comparable software-based scanner (SVI,
ScanView) are shown in Fig. 14. The SVI software-based

system processes 128 real ultrasonic lines sampled at
16 MS/s. Its analog front end is similar to the one present-
ed above, and its demodulator is based on a conventional
digital mixer. To obtain fair comparisons, only the near-
est-neighbor interpolation postprocessing is enabled and
all other postprocessings are disabled. The background
material of the phantom is made of Zerdine, and sound
speed is set at 1540 m/s. The attenuation coefficients are
0.50  dB/cm/MHz for zone 1 and 0.70  dB/cm/MHz for
zone 2. Wire targets are made from nylon monofilament
with a diameter of 0.1 mm.
According to GP2000 probe specifications, axial and
lateral resolutions cannot be lower than 1 mm. Obtained
images show that it is possible to obtain 2 mm and 1 mm
for lateral and axial resolution, with the hardware-based
system architecture of adapted approach with n = 64 and
P = 10. Note that the moiré pattern is normal because no
interpolation was applied with the hardware-based system
but it soils the lateral resolution. On the other hand, the
SV1 software-based system, having a lateral resolution of
3 mm and an axial resolution of 2 mm, is comparable to
the hardware-based system (Adapted method with n = 16
and P = 14).
The power requirements for the entire system are mea-
sured at 2.36 W, including 500 mW for the probe motor
and 600 mW for the TFT-LCD. The dynamic power break-
down for the processing core is 5 mW for the PSRAM,
60 mW for the FPGA core, and 120 mW for all digital IOs
(Table II). Only 16.7% of the total power is consumed by
the hardware-based digital ultrasound preprocessing core.
The proposed architecture uses 9 times less power than a
comparable software-based scanner (SVI), which requires
an average of 20 W.
V. Conclusion
We present a digital FPGA-based, real-time, low-cost,
low-power ultrasound RF quadrature demodulator proces-
sor implemented within a hand-held ultrasonic medical
imaging device. The architecture is completely implement-
ed in a single low-cost FPGA with 3 different complexi-
ties. A method to evaluate the system at a given complex-
ity and algorithm is also presented. The results suggest
that adapted bandwidth HT provides better noise filtering
than the same order conventional HT. In addition, the
proposed solution preserves software implementation flex-
ibility, so that different coefficient sets can be loaded on
the fly to support different probes. Furthermore, when im-
plemented along the lines described here, the demodulator
can also be used in a high-frequency ultrasound-imaging
device, because its fully pipelined architecture operates at
the sample frequency. For a 20 MHz sample clock and a
15-frame-per-second display rate, the hand-held ultrasonic
imaging-processing core (FPGA, memory) requires only
45 mW (dynamic). Finally, the architecture was validated
