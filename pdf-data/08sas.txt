Abstract—Piezoelectricity is an ability of some materials to
generate an electric potential in response to applied mechanical
stress. Piezoelectric ceramics are often used for sensory systems
to monitor mechanical characteristics of structures through an
electrical signal. Thus, to support system level analysis and
evaluation of sensory systems, understanding and estimating the
electrical behavior of piezoelectric ceramics with a minimum
effort is valuable. This paper proposes an equivalent circuit
model for piezoelectric ceramics, with a PZT patch as the
specimen. The proposed model approximates the electrical
behavior of piezoelectric ceramics with up to 100% accuracy for
unloaded and 93% accuracy for loaded PZT, and provides a
modeling procedure that can easily be automated.

I. INTRODUCTION
Piezoelectricity is an ability to generate an electric potential
in response to applied mechanical stress [1]. As the
piezoelectric effect is reversible, materials that demonstrate the
direct piezoelectric effect, which is the generation of electricity
upon applied mechanical stress, also demonstrate the converse
piezoelectric effect, which is the generation of stress and strain
upon applied electric field [2]. There are different types of
piezoelectric materials, and some representative materials
include quartz and Lead-Zirconate Titanate (PZT), which are a
natural crystal and a man-made ceramic, respectively.
Impedance-based structural health monitoring (SHM) is one
of the applications, where a piezoelectric ceramic is used. A
piezoelectric transducer made of a single layer piezoelectric
ceramic is usually utilized for impedance-based SHM as a
collocated sensor/actuator to monitor mechanical conditions of
a structure through electrical signals. PZT, which is a
surface-mountable sensor/actuator in a form of a thin patch, is
the most widely used piezoelectric ceramic due to its high
actuation ability [1][3]. When an electric field is placed across
the thickness of a PZT patch as the original polarization field,
the PZT patch expands along the axis of polarization (thickness

direction) and contracts perpendicular to the axis of
polarization (length and width direction) [6]. PZT typically
changes its shape up to 0.1% of the original dimension [1][2].
For sensory systems relying on piezoelectricity, such as
impedance-based SHM systems, it is important to model the
piezoelectric behavior of a piezoelectric ceramic itself and the
interaction between a piezoelectric ceramic and the structure in
terms of an electrical equivalent circuit, to conduct system level
analysis and performance evaluation intensively. There are
several previous approaches on modeling the piezoelectric
behavior with an electrical equivalent circuit, but they do not
provide a modeling procedure that can be easily automated, and
do not present quantitative performance of their equivalent
circuit models [3]-[5]. This work proposes a systematic
procedure to model the piezoelectric behavior of an unloaded or
loaded piezoelectric ceramic. It also presents quantitative
performance of the proposed model in terms of correlation
coefficients.
II. EXISTING EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT MODELS
A. Unloaded Piezoelectric Ceramics
The most basic equivalent circuit model characterizing a
piezoelectric ceramic near the resonant frequency is the Van
Dyke Model shown in Figure 1, which is often adopted to
model electromechanical resonance characteristics of crystal
oscillators [7][8]. The Van Dyke Model is a parallel connection
of a series RLC representing mechanical damping, mass, and
elastic compliance, and a capacitor representing the
electrostatic capacitance between the two parallel plates of the
PZT patch [7].
Figure 1 The Van Dyke Model
The Van Dyke Model cannot accurately model the material
characteristics, particularly for materials with significant losses
[4]. The Sherrit Model employs complex circuit components,
as shown in Figure 2, to model the piezoelectric ceramic with
piezoelectric losses. Circuit component values of the Sherrit
Model are complex numbers, while those of the Van Dyke
Model are real numbers.

Figure 2 The Sherrit Model – Unloaded piezoelectric ceramics
The Guan Model, which is the most recently proposed,
estimates values of the electrical components based on the
electrical behavior of the piezoelectric ceramics [3]. The Guan
model, as shown in Figure 3, adds a series resistor Rs and a
parallel resistor Rp to C0 of the Van Dyke Model to account for
the energy dissipation. Determination of the values of the
electric components C0, C1, L1 and R1 relies on visual inspection
on the magnitude and phase of the impedance, and values of Rs
and Rp are decided by the amount of energy dissipation [3].
The Guan Model attempts to improve the accuracy of the
Van Dyke Model by encompassing Rs and Rp as a consideration
of the energy dissipation. However, the values of Rs and Rp
may introduce inaccuracy as the energy loss is dependent on the
amplitude and the frequency of the excitation signal [3].
Figure 3 The Guan Model – Unloaded piezoelectric ceramics
B. Loaded Piezoelectric Ceramics
When a piezoelectric ceramic is mounted to a mechanical
structure, the mechanical boundary conditions of the
piezoelectric ceramic change [3], and, accordingly, a different
circuit model is required for a loaded piezoelectric ceramic.
Since a loaded piezoelectric ceramic experiences multiple
resonances, a circuit model for a wide frequency range with
multiple resonant frequencies can be employed to model the
behavior of a loaded piezoelectric ceramic. As shown in Figure
4, additional R-C-L branches are added in parallel to the
R1-C1-L1 branch of the Van Dyke Model [7].
The Guan Model is also extended to accommodate a loaded
piezoelectric ceramic based on the extended Van Dyke Model,
as shown in Figure 5. Each series RLC branch physically
stands for a mechanical resonant mode. The values of Ri, Ci,
and Li, for i from 1 to n, are determined by the same method to
obtain the values of R1, C1, and L1 discussed in Section II.A.
The complete Guan Model has difficulty in determining values
of Ri, Ci, and Li when the resonant frequencies of the
piezoelectric ceramic and structure are close to or overlapping
with each other [3].

III. TEST CONFIGURATIONS
We present a systematic procedure to model a piezoelectric
ceramic, and its model is called the Easy Model. As the first
step to develop the Easy Model, the electrical properties of the
piezoelectric ceramic are investigated by measuring the
electrical impedance of the piezoelectric ceramic using an
impedance analyzer such as HP 4194A. The impedance is
measured from 10 KHz to 100 KHz with a frequency resolution
of 20 Hz. A PZT sheet PSI-5H4E-T110 available from Piezo
Systems, Inc. is selected as a piezoelectric ceramic in
developing the Easy Model and cut into a smaller piece to be
used as a specimen.
The test configurations for unloaded PZT and loaded PZT
are illustrated in Figure 6. The PZT patch is excited with an
electrical signal to produce a mechanical actuation on the
structure, and the mechanical response from the structure is
measured through the PZT patch in the form of an electrical
signal. Thus, a pair of wires should be connected to each face
of the PZT patch. Since the PZT patch is attached to the surface
of a structure, one side of a loaded PZT patch is not accessible.
Thus, a piece of copper tape is used to provide a route to the
bottom of the PZT patch that is contacting the structure as
shown in Figure 6 (b). For the purpose of symmetry, a piece of
copper tape with the same size is also attached to the top of the
PZT patch, and q wire is soldered to each of the two pieces of
copper tape. Since the copper tape thickness shown in Figure 6
is only 35 µm, a loaded PZT patch has almost full contact with
the structure, and the gap between the PZT patch and a structure
shown in Figure 6 (b) is not to scale. As presented in Figure 6
(a), unloaded PZT includes the PZT patch and the copper tape

unloaded and loaded cases.

IV. PROPOSED EASY MODEL FOR UNLOADED PIEZOELECTRIC
CERAMICS
A. Proposed Model
The measured impedance of unloaded PZT is presented in
Figure 8. From the reactance curve shown in Figure 8 (a) and
the magnitude curve in Figure 8 (b), one can observe that the
specimen has a series resonance at 45 KHz and a parallel
resonance at 55 KHz. Note that the magnitude becomes the
maximum (minimum) at the parallel (series) resonance. Figure
8 (a) indicates that the PZT patch is inductive between the
series resonant frequency and the parallel resonant frequency
and capacitive in other frequency ranges. In a low frequency
range, the reactance approaches negative infinity as the
frequency decreases. It can also be noted from the resistance
curve that the base resistance outside the resonant frequency
range is about 5 Ω.
Since it is easy to identify the parallel resonant frequency
from the measured impedance, the resonance characteristics of
unloaded PZT can be modeled using a parallel RLC tank
circuit. A resistor in series to the RLC tank circuit is connected,
as unloaded PZT demonstrates nearly constant resistance over
the frequency range away from the resonant frequency. Also,
as the reactance converges to negative infinity as the frequency
approaches DC, a series capacitor to an RLC tank circuit is
added. The Easy Model is shown in Figure 9. The model has
an RLC tank circuit with a resistor and a capacitor in series.
The impedance of unloaded PZT through the Easy Model is
given as:

Note that the Easy Model is another form of the Van Dyke
Model. The series RLC branch and a parallel capacitor of the
Van Dyke Model are transformed into a parallel RLC tank and
a series capacitor in the Easy Model. The series to parallel
conversion of the RLC components makes the calculation of
the electrical component values of the model simple. So the
Easy Model is suitable for automating the modeling process.

B. Determination of Component Values
The next step for the Easy Model is to determine the values
of electrical components. The resistance value R0 can be
determined from the resistance curve at a DC or very high
frequency. It is approximately 5 Ω from Figure 8 (a). The
series capacitor value C0 is from the reactance curve by taking a
negative inverse of the reactance value at DC. It is 150 nF from
Figure 8 (a). The parallel resonant frequency ωp is determined
124
also from the reactance curve, and is 55 KHz from Figure 8 (a).

is straightforward from the measured impedance and can easily
be automated. The component values are summarized in Table

The dotted lines in Figure 10 show the estimated impedance
of the specimen based on the Easy Model. From a visual
inspection, the Easy Model follows the trends of the measured
impedance in four aspects, resistance, reactance, magnitude
and phase. Correlation coefficient indicates the strength and
direction of a linear relationship between two variables [10].
Thus, for a quantitative comparison, correlation coefficients
between the measured and the modeled impedance are
calculated, and summarized in
Table 2. As seen in the table, the correlation coefficients are
about 0.99 for all the four parameters.

The unloaded PZT illustrated in this section includes
impurities, two pieces of copper tape, as shown in Figure 6 (a),
and the impurities cause a local resonant frequency around 68
KHz. The local resonant frequency is ignored for the unloaded
PZT, but is discussed in the next section.

V. EASY MODEL FOR LOADED PIEZOELECTRIC CERAMICS
A. Proposed Model
As mentioned in Section II.B, mechanical structures usually
have multiple resonant frequencies depending on their
mechanical characteristics. Thus, when a PZT patch is bonded
to a structure, the resonant mode of unloaded PZT has
interaction with each resonant mode of the structure, as shown
in Figure 11. In the figure, n is the number of resonant
frequencies of the structure, and the subscripts pmu and s
denote unloaded PZT Model and Structure, respectively.
Figure 11 Interaction between unloaded PZT and a structure
The interaction between PZT and the structure can be
explained with a concept of a transformer as shown in Figure
12. The top two figures of Figure 12 show the equivalent
circuit model of PZT and a structure at a resonant frequency
125
using an RLC tank circuit based on the Easy Model. The Zpmu1
block represents the resonance of PZT, and the Zsi block
represents one of the resonances of the structure. When a PZT
patch is bonded to the surface of a structure, the interaction
between a PZT patch and a resonance frequency of the structure
may be modeled as a transformer with a transfer ratio of Np:Ns
as shown in the second figure of Figure 12. Note the inductors
of RLC tank circuits, Lpmu1 and Lsi, are distributed into two
elements satisfying Lpmu1 = Lpmu11 || Lpmu12 and Lsi = Lsi1 || Lsi2.
As illustrated in the third figure of Figure 12, the inductance
of PZT constituting the transformer, Lpmu12, can be replaced
with the structure’s impedance seen by PZT, Zsi’, where

the Easy Model for loaded PZT. Note the values of R0 and C0
should be determined according to the measured impedance of

B. Performance Analysis
It is observed from the measured impedance curves that
loaded PZT exhibits multiple resonant frequencies, especially
in frequency ranges from 12 KHz to 20 KHz and from 65 KHz
to 72 KHz. To demonstrate the performance of the Easy Model
for loaded PZT, a representative frequency range from 12 KHz
to 20 KHz is selected for experiments.
The component values for loaded PZT are obtained in the
same manner for unloaded PZT covered in Section IV.A.
There are 50 resonant frequencies in the selected frequency
range. The dotted lines in Figure 14 show the estimated
impedance of loaded PZT based on the Easy Model. From a
visual inspection, the Easy Model follows the trend of the
measured impedance of loaded PZT in all the four values,
resistance, reactance, magnitude, and phase.

are calculated separately for resistance, reactance, magnitude,

the frequency resolution of the measured impedance is
increased.

C. Revisit to Unloaded Model
Based on the Easy Model accommodating multiple resonant
frequencies, the unloaded PZT estimation conducted in Section
IV.C is revisited to incorporate a local resonant frequency using
the model developed for loaded PZT illustrated in Figure 13.
We considered two RLC tank circuits accounting for the
primary and local resonance frequencies. The values for two
tank circuits based on measurements are given in Table 4. Note
that the values for a primary parallel resonance remain the
same.

The revised model for unloaded PZT with two resonant
frequencies offers a better agreement with the measured
impedance as shown in Figure 15. The correlation between the
estimated impedance and the measured one is given in Table 5.
The average correlation improves to nearly 100 % compared to
99 % for the previous model with only a primary resonant
circuit.

VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes an equivalent circuit model that can
represent the electrical behaviors of unloaded and loaded
piezoelectric ceramics. A circuit model offers easy analysis
and quick performance estimation of sensory systems without
lengthy measurements. The proposed model can be developed
solely from the measured impedance of PZT and does not
require any information about the material itself. The proposed
model also provides high accuracy, average 99 % or above
agreement rate for an unloaded PZT ceramic and 93 % for a
loaded piezoelectric ceramic. The modeling procedure is
straightforward for easy automation.
