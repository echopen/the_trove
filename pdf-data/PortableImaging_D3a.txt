Similar to fixed, cart-based systems, portable ultrasounds use an array of receivers to build an image by time shifting, scaling, and intelligently
summing echo energy. Time shifting and scaling, based on receiving signals from a transducer array, provides the ability to “focus” on a single
point in the scan region. By subsequently focusing on numerous points individually, an image is assembled.
The challenge of designing an effective portable ultrasound, however, is maintaining acceptable image quality while achieving portability in
terms of size and runtime. Often the number of channels used in the device is reduced, sacrificing image quality and information for a reduction
in power consumption and size. Fortunately, TI has developed a better alternative. TI’s integrated solutions help increase signal integrity and
reliability. For example, fully-integrated analog front ends reduce noise and the overall number of
components needed to support the channels.
Homogenous DSPs provide the processing horsepower needed for compute intensive
applications typical for the image conditioning and reconstruction that occurs after image
acquisition. The heterogeneous multicore SoCs split the system management/user interaction
and image-display preparation functions between a GPP core and a DSP integrated on a single
chip. The DSP can perform many functions such as data interpolation, magnitude estimation, log
compression, scan conversion, and others. At the same time, GPP cores provide the functional
equivalent of a PC processor — at a fraction of the power consumption.
