Compound scanner
Scan-arm with localizer for a compound system
(Combison 202 Kretz) necessary for manual

position and the direction of the transducer is
gathered. These data are captured as analog
electrical signals via mechanically-linked
potentiometers and are simultaneously processed
in the ultrasonic system.
The accuracy of the data collected in this way
substantially determines the precision and the
quality of the ultrasound images.

type of device: mechan. Sector producer/distributor: Siemens AG, Erlangen
B-Mode development: 1961-1965
frequency: 2.5 MHz time of production: 1965-1975
Mechanical linear sector scanner
Scanner unit of the first real-time ultrasound system
(Vidoson 635).
Three successively activated ultrasonic transmitters
rotate in the focal plane of a parabolic reflector.
This reflector transforms the original sector scan to a
(linear) parallel scan. The reason for this unorthodox
solution: The constant rotation of the transducers
is – contrary to repetitive longitudinal motions - not
subject to inertial force. Therefore scanning time and
frame rate are not limited, as they would be in case
of longitudinal motions of the transducer.
The longitudinal axis of the rotating transducers can
be shifted. In this way the section plane can be varied
up to 3.5 cm without moving the complete scanning
unit which is connected to the patient‘s skin. This
method was intended to facilitate ultrasonic mamma
inspections.

Curved Array
Curved arrays are a variety of linear arrays.
They only differ in the way the transducer elements
are aligned. The same technology is applied in
both cases.
In linear arrays – as the name implies – the
elements are arranged in a straight line, while in
curved arrays this line is curved along a more or
less rounded arc. The image format of the
curved array thus resembles a ring segment.
Curved arrays have the advantage – depending
on the field of application – of combining the
characteristics of both a sector scanner
(small connecting area) and a
linear array (large field of view).

Prototype of a the very first multiline
array. By subdividing an array
system into several parallel and separately-
activated array lines, a dynamic focusing
perpendicular to the direction of the
scanning is possible (annular array) –
unlike the array transducers with just one
line of arrays which are still common today.
In theory this method should have great
diagnostic advantages. The high technolo-
gical and electronic complexity of the
method hasn’t found wide-spread use
in ultrasound equipment.

Linear Array
Example of the delicate architecture of a linear array
structure. Here each single circuit-relevant element
is again mechanically subdivided, in order to suppress
unwanted oscillations. For attenuation the ceramic
elements are embedded at the back in a supporting
cushion to prevent resonances.
Furthermore, two transformational layers with different
wave impedance are visible. They are necessary
to adapt the acoustical impedance of the ceramic
elements to biological tissues. This adaptation leads
not only to better sound transmission; it also leads to
an enlargement of the usable ultrasound frequencies
and thus to better image quality. The top layer is
formed by a so-called silicon lens, which not only
protects the arrays but also helps focus the
ultrasound beam at a right angle to the scan
direction, contributing to better image quality.
