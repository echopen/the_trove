[57] ABSTRACT
The probe has a casing provided with an ultrasonically
transmissive window and containing a couplant liquid
in which are immersed a piezoelectric disc, an electric
motor and a mechanical coupling between the motor
shaft and the disc. The mechanical coupling comprises
a connecting rod driven at one end by the shaft in a
conical motion about the shaft axis, which is at right
angles to the disc and to the window. The disc is rotat
ably supported about a diametrical axis which is ?xedly
positioned with respect to the casing. A yoke which has
a bracket secured to the connecting rod at the opposite
end thereof, is rotatably supported about an axis which
is ?xedly positioned with respect to the disc and at right
angles to the diametrical axis. The mechanical coupling
transmits an oscillating motion to the disc about the
diametrical axis.

ULTRASONIC SCANNING PROBE WITH
MECHANICAL SECTOR SCANNING MEANS
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to equipment for medical ultra
sonic scanning comprising an ultrasonic transducer
devised to generate a beam which describes a relatively
rapid angular scan in a plane of inspection and is trans
mitted to the medium being inspected by a couplant
liquid contained in a chamber.
It relates more particularly to an ultrasonic scanning
probe comprising a housing containing the couplant
liquid and provided with a window through which the
ultrasonic beam passes, in which are immersed a piezo
electric component in the form of a disc, an electric
motor unit and mechanical means of producing the
angular deviation of the beam according to the angular
position of the motor shaft; the probe further preferably
comprising means providing continuous indication of
the angular position of the beam.
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION
Such a probe is intended for real time ultrasonic scan
ning in applications such as cardiology, opthalmology
and obstetrics, where the number of images per second
that the instrument must display is for example of the
order of 25 to 50 and where it is important to have a
probe that is extremely light, compact, easy to use,
inexpensive and completely reliable. In some of these
applications, it is useful to be able to operate the equip
ment either using the so called “B scan,” in which the
trace on the display CRT occupies, at each moment, a
position representing that of the ultrasonic beam in the
medium being examined, or according to the so called
“TM” or “time movement” mode, in which, the probe
being stationary, the changes with time ofthe structures
being examined are displayed.
For the “B scan” mode, it is suf?cient for the probe to
provide a continuous indication of the angular position
of the ultrasonic beam: ultrasonic scanning equipment
provided with suitable facilities for controlling the devi
ation of the electronic beam on the basis of this informa
tion are well known, and the invention does not relate
to such means. 7
In the “TM mode,” the equipment normally com
prises facilities for displaying, on the CRT screen, a
bright line which can be moved on the screen to a part
of the image the movement of which it is desired to
observe. When this selection has been made, the ultra
‘ sonic beam should be brought into the corresponding
angular position and ?xed in this position and means
must be provided for effecting the appropriate angular
movement of the beam.
The invention provides particularly simple and ad
vantageous mechanical means of producing the angular
deviation of the ultrasonic beam.
Another of its objects is a system for indicating the
angular position of the ultrasonic beam, particularly
suitable for cooperating with the said means of devia
tion.

Finally, its object is a system which will be associated >
with the probe, to produce the said angular displace
‘ ment of the beam suitable for changing over the inspec
tion equipment into TM mode, a system which advanta
geously cooperates with the said means of deviation.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
‘In accordance with an important special feature of
the invention, the piezoelectric component being in the
form of a disc, the motor unit has a shaft arranged per
pendicularly to the said window along a first axis, the
said mechanical means comprise a connecting rod
driven in a conical motion around the said ?rst axis, by
a mechanical linkage to the 'said shaft so arranged that
the connecting rod rotates on itself without a transla
tional movement along its own direction, means for
rotatably supporting the piezoelectric disc about a dia
metrical axis which is ?xedly positioned with respect to
the casing, the said first axis and the said diametrical axis
being located in one and the same plane and perpendic
ular to one another and a yoke mounted for swivelling
around an axis passing through the centre of the piezo
electric disc, said axis being ?xedly positioned with
respect to the disc and perpendicular to the said diamet
rical axis, the said yoke comprising a bracket ?xed to
that end of the said connecting rod which is not linked
to the said shaft.
The invention also proposes to incorporate in a probe
of the type mentioned above, in addition to a principal
chamber which houses the piezoelectric disc, contains a
couplant liquid in which the speed of propagation ofthe
ultrasonic waves is appreciably different from their
velocity of propagation in water, and is closed, in the
direction of transmission of the ultrasonic beam, by a
flexible membrane, an auxiliary chamber, bounded by
the said principal membrane and by a flexible auxiliary
membrane and containing water, the two membranes
and the couplant liquid having substantially the same
acoustic impedance as water, and at least part of the
surface of the said principal membrane being suffi
ciently ?exible to ensure equilibrium between the liquid
pressures in the two chambers.
With this'arrangement, the auxiliary membrane can
distort when it is applied to the skin without this distor
sion being transmitted to the principal membrane,
which forms the interface between the two liquids and,
as a result, no distortion of the sound waves accompa
nies their refraction.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED 5
EMBODIMENT
FIGS. 1 and 2 show a probe consisting of a piezoelec
tric ceramic disc-shaped pellet 1 located in proximity to
a membrane 21 transparent to ultrasonic waves, in a
housing 2 which contains a couplant liquid. The latter is
preferably of the type in which the speed of propaga
tion of the ultrasonic waves is lower than their speed of
propagation in water, for example certain fluorinated
liquids.
Such a liquid is inert, which ‘makes it possible to use
a submerged motor. The housing 2 is in the form of an
elongated cylinder terminating in a frusto-conical part
the end of which is closed by the membrane 21. Item 22
is a cable providing electrical connection between the
probe and the transmitter and receiver circuits which
the inspection equipment incorporates. The means
proper to the invention which enable a single cable to
be used will be explained later.
A motor 3 is ?xed to the housing by means of a sleeve
340 pierced by channels 341 which allow the couplant
liquid to circulate.
The transducer 1 is made to oscillate about an axis
100, perpendicular to the plane of FIG. 1, by means of
a motor 3 with very low inertia, the shaft 31 of which is
arranged along the axis of the housing 2 and which
oscillates for example by :20” about a reference posi
tion de?ned by a magnetic or elastic system, as will be
explained in due course. A disc 32 is mounted on the
shaft 31 perpendicular to the axis of the housing 2. A
connecting rod 33 is joined to the disc 32, in a manner
which will be explained in due course, at a peripheral
point 330 of the disc 32; the connecting rod 33 cooper
ates with a yoke 34 ?xed to the pellet 1, in a manner
which will be explained in due course hereafter.
FIG. 3 shows the linkage between the disc 32 and the
connecting rod 33. The end of the connecting rod can
be seen to be ?tted in bearing 331-332, in such a way
that the only motion that the connecting rod 33 is able
to describe with respect to the disc 32 is a rotation upon
itself about its own axis, to the exclusion of any transla
tional motion parallel to this axis.
FIG. 2 shows that the connecting rod 33 is ?xed to
the yoke 34 at a point such that the centreline of the said
connecting rod passes through the centre 0 of the disc 1.
The connecting rod therefore describes a conical mo
tion about the axis of symmetry of the transducer,
which passes through 0 and coincides with the axis of
the shaft 31. The half angle of the cone will for example
be of the order of 45°.
The ceramic pellet 1 is ?xed to the bottom of a bush
101 which is in turn fastened to a supporting cap 102.
The components 101 and 102 may be in plastic material
and the gap 103 between the sidewall of the cap and the
bush 101 will with advantage be ?lled with adhesive.
On the said wall of the cap, at the two opposite ends of 60
diameter 104 (see FIG. 2) of the pellet 1 perpendicular
to the axis 100, are ?tted two trunnions 105—106 (FIGS.
2 and 4) which respectively cooperate with bearings
107—108 respectively, the outer cage which is attached,
as shown in FIG. 4, to the ends of the yoke 34.
It is obvious that the only motion that the disc 1 can
describe is an alternating oscillation about the axis 100.
The latter is de?ned by two trunnions 1001 and 1002
10
40
45
50
698
4
also ?xed to the cap 102 and respectively cooperating
with bearings, not shown, ?xed to the housing 2. The
axis 104 itself oscillates in the plane passing through 0
and perpendicular to axis 100, and the yoke 34 can itself
only oscillate about the moving axes 104 and 33. In fact
the oscillation of pellet 1, of the order of :20D to i25°
for example, is obtained solely from rotatory motions,
using components without play or slipping. It is clear
that the disc 32 may be replaced by a crank.
Besides the resulting reliability, this system has the
advantage that there is a unique relation between the
angular positions of the shaft 31 and of the pellet 1,
which facilitates the indication of the angular deviation
of the transmitted beam. It will be noted that the system
is completely distributed about the axis of the motor,
which makes it possible to construct a coaxial probe,
particularly convenient to use, notably in cardiology.
. FIG. 5 shows the disc 32 seen from above and a
transverse section of the housing 2. It can be seen that
two small magnets 201 and 202 are ?tted radially on the
inner face of the housing 2, a little above the surface of
the disc. The latter itself carries a radial magnet 320.
These three magnets are magnetized in directions tan
gential to the circumference of the disc and arranged in
such a way that the magnet 320 presents poles respec
tively opposite the poles of magnets 201 and 202, oppo
site poles being of the same sign. As a result, owing to
repulsion, the magnet 320 will take up a position of
equilibrium between the positions of magnets 201 and
202, equidistant from these if they are identical, in the
absense of motor drive. The angle between the radii
passing through the magnets 201 and 202 must obvi
ously be slightly greater than the oscillatory angle of
the shaft 31. In this way, a reference angular position of
the shaft 31 is de?ned.
It will be noted that this system of magnetic damping
(not shown on FIG. 2 with a view to simpli?cation)
could not only be ?tted on another rotating component
fastened to the motor shaft, but could be replaced by an
elastic damping system using a spring or any another
appropriate means. It is nevertheless particularly simple
and reliable. Similarly, the motor could be replaced by
a galvanometer system.
The membrane 21, in cases when the couplant liquid
contained in the housing is ofthe type mentioned above,
will with advantage be of a flexible type and associated
with a second ?exible membrane bounding with the
?rst an auxiliary chamber containing water.
However in certain cases it will be possible to waive
this provision and merely to line the membrane 21 with
a material absorbing ultrasonic waves, with the effect of
reducing spurious re?ections at the membrane.
FIG. 6 shows a sawtooth of squarewave generator 35
having for example a repetition frequency of 100 Hz,
intended to provide, through an ampli?er 84, a resistor
350 and high value inductances 351 and 352 (for exam
ple 100 mH) linked together by a coaxial cable 6, the
excitation current for the motor 3. This has been sym
bolized by a back-EMF (which will be proportional to
speed) in series with a resistor 300 and an inductance
301.
At 4 is shown the pulse transmitter (having a repeti
tion frequency for example of between 2 and 5 MHz)
and at 5 the receiver embodied in the inspection equip
ment. These components are connected to the induc
tance 351, through a capacitor 353, while the induc
tance 352 is connected to the transducer 1 through a
capacitor 354.
4,418,698

The output of the generator 35 is connected to
ground through a potentiometer 355, in series with a
resistor 356. A differential ampli?er 357 has its output
connected, through a resistor 358, to the negative input
of an operational ampli?er 359, the positive input of
which is connected to ground. The output of ampli?er
359 is connected to its negative input through a capaci
tor 360 on which a resistor 361 is connected in parallel. '
The output of the ampli?er 359 is connected to the
control electrode of the CRT through a circuit which
will be described in due course hereafter. '
The inputs of the ampli?er 357 are vconnected to the
cursor ofthe potentiometer 355 and, respectively, to the
point common to the resistor 350 and the inductance
351.
The low frequency current which flows in the resis
tor 350, the inductances 351 and 352 and the rotor wind
ings ofthe motor, is obviously transmitted neither to the
transmitter and receiver units 4 and 5 (it is blocked by
the capacitor 353), nor to the transducer 1' (capacitor
354). Similarly, the high frequency current which is
transmitted by the transmitter 4 to the transducer 1 and
from the latter to the receiver 5, by the capacitors 353
and 354 does not perturb (choke inductances 351-352)
the path of the low frequency current mentioned above.
It can be seen that in the circuit described the ?nal result
is that the connection between the transducer 1 and the
external circuits can be made using a single coaxial
cable.
The circuit described serves to provide, at the output
of the operational ampli?er 359 which functions‘ as an
integrating circuit, a voltage proportional to the angular
‘deviation 0 of the motor (and therefore of the trans
ducer) with respect to a reference position, as will now
be explained.
The series resistors 355 and 356 on the one hand, the
_ resistor 350 is series with the motor impedance on the
' . other hand, form a bridge in one of the diagonals of
which is connected the ampli?er 357. (The inductances
351 and 352 having negligible impedance at 100 Hz).
' When the bridge is in equilibrium, obtained when the
1 motor is stopped by suitably adjustng the potentiometer
‘ _ v355, there is no potential at the terminals ofthe ampli?er
-' 357. In operation, the voltage at said terminals is ?nally
" proportional to the back EMF E, which it itself propor
tional to the speed of the motor. By integration, we
. therefore obtain, at the output of the ampli?er 359, a
voltage proportional to_ the angle of deviation 0.
v ' In order to obtain an absolute indication of the angu~
lar position, it is necessary ?rst that a mechanical refer
ence position of the oscillating assembly should be de
?ned, and secondly that the output voltage from the
integrator 359 be zero in the absence of an input signal
" (in orderwords when the motor is blocked).
The ?rst result is obtained by means of the magnetic
1 system already described, which brings the motor shaft
- into a well speci?ed position in the absence of excitation
current. _ , . r
The second result is obtained by means of the capaci
tor 360 and the resistor 361. The capacitor 360 charges
up in the presence of a voltage at the ampli?er input. In
the absence of such a voltage, it gradually discharges
through the resistor 361, so that the ampli?er output
voltage is, after a certain interval, returned to zero.
, The information on the angular deviation is applied
to a system 7, well known initself, which also receives
at its input 700 the transmission synchronization signals
(coming from terminal 40 of the transmitter 4) and pro
20

vides, on the deviation electrodes X and Y of the CRT,
a sawtooth potential of instantaneous amplitude propor
tional to t sine 0 and t cos 0 respective, where t is time.
Two switches 70-71 enable these voltages to be substi
tuted by potentials supplied by two scanning generators
72-73 respectively. The generator 72 provides a slow
scan on the screen and the generator 73 a conventional
type scan (a sawtooth waveform synchronized with the
transmission, terminal 730 being connected to terminal
40 for this purpose).
The output of the ampli?er-integrating circuit 359 is
also fed to a differential ampli?er 8, arranged as a com
parator, the output of which is connected, through a
capacitor 80, an ampli?er 81 which itselfis connected to
the Z brightness control electrode of the CRT. The
other input of the ampli?er 81 is connected to the out
put 50 of the receiver 5 through a resistor 51, while the
other input of the ampli?er circuit 8 is connected to the
cursor of a potentiometer 82 to the terminals of which is
supplied a d-c voltage. The said cursor is connected to
ground through a potentiometer 83, the cursor of which
is connected to the input of ampli?er 84 through a
switch 85. The other input of the ampli?er 84 is con
nected to the generator 35 through a switch 86 and its
output feeds the windings of the motor 3.
When the switch 86 is closed and switch 85 open, the
voltage supplied to the motor is that provided by the
generator 35 and the motor describes an oscillating
motion as indicated above. At this moment, the
switches 70 and 71 are in the position shown as “B” on
the drawing, such that the CRT tube is scanned in the B
mode.
The comparator 8 compares the d-c voltage K00
tapped on the potentiometer 82 with the voltage K6
tapped at the output of the integrating circuit 359 and
superposes on the video information fed to the Z elec
trode a square signal whenever K0=K60. As a result,
for a given ‘angular position of the ultrasonic beam, a
bright line is displayed on the screen.
When it is desired to observe a speci?c structure in
motion displayed on the screen according to the TM
mode, the potentiometer 82 is adjusted to bring the
bright line on ‘the said structure.
At this time, the switches 70-71-85-86 are operated.
The result is ?rst that the screen is scanned, in a manner
well known in itself, according to the TM mode, and
secondly that the motor is no longer excited except by
a d-c voltage KK100, K1 being a coef?cient of propor
tionality which depends on the setting of potentiometer
83. This voltage generates a driving torque which
causes the motor rotor to turn through a certain angle,
until it reaches equilibrium with the restoring torque
determined by the magnetic arrangement described
above. The potentiometer 83 has been set by the manu
facturer so that this equilibrium position corresponds
precisely to the one de?ned by the inlet line described
above. The result is that the probe stops at the said
position.
It will be appreciated that the changeover from B to
TM mode is thus obtained in a simple manner, as a result
of the fact that the transducer drive mechanism pos
sesses a restoring torque to reset it into a reference
position.
FIG. 7 shows a variant of the bridge for measuring
the speed of rotation of the motor which is part of the
circuit of FIG. 6. In this variant the resistor 355 of FIG.
6 is replaced by a variable gain ampli?er 364 in series
with the resistor 356, the gain of which is controlled by
4,418,698
7
a d-c voltage from a synchronous demodulator 365,
after ?ltering through the unit made up of the resistor
366 and the capacitor 367. The synchronous demodula
tor 365 is fed on the one hand by the output of the
differential ampli?er 357 of the bridge and on the other
hand by a voltage at 1000 Hz for example applied to
terminal 362. This latter voltage, preferably at a high
enough frequency not to drive the motor, is also fed,
through a capacitor 363, to the point common to the
resistor 350 and the input of the ampli?er 364. The
inductances 351 to 352, which play no role in the bridge
balance, have not been shown in order to simplify the
drawing. It is clear that at 1000 Hz, the bridge must be
in balance, even if the motor is running, since it gener
ates no back EMF at this frequency.
The demodulator 365, of a type well known in itself,
generates a d-c voltage proportional in amplitude and in
sign to the residual signal at 1000 Hz which is emitted
from the ampli?er 357 when the bridge is not balanced
at 1000 Hz (for example owing to the probe being
changed). This d-c voltage modi?es the gain of the
ampli?er 364 in such a way as to restore the automatic
balance of the bridge.
For purposes of simpli?cation, FIG. 8 shows only the
piezoelectric transducer 10, which describes an oscilla
tory motion about an axis 1010 perpendicular to the
plane of the ?gure, driven by an electric motor, symbol
ized by a rectangle shown by a dotted line 1020 and a
linkage mechanism, shown by a dotted line 1030. These
components are housed in a metal or plastic casing,
comprising a cylindrical part 110 extended by a frusto
conical section 111 open at its base, joined together in a
detachable manner. The frusto conical part is encircled,
near its base, by a strip 112, consisting of a very thin and
very ?exible ?lm, for example in natural rubber, glued
to the casing, and facing this strip, the casing 111 com
prises windows 1110 to 1113 (see FIGS. 9 and 10).
The base of the part 111 of the casing is closed by a
membrane 113 held in position by bonding or provided
with a circular lip and ?tted by pressure. This mem
brane is made up of a relatively ?exible material with an
acoustic impedance water, such as a natural rubber, a
silicone-containing elastomer, a polyethylene or the
plastics material marketed under the name “Dutral,” a
trade-mark registered by the ?rm Montedison (polethy
lene-propylene).
In this latter case, the membrane is suf?ciently stiff to
be shaped and to keep its shape in the absence of stress,
whereby, instead ofbeing stretched ?at, it can be given
a predetermined curvature.
A threaded bush 12 ?xed to the part 111 close to its
connection with the part 110 of the casing, cooperates
with a sleeve in rigid material 13 itself internally
threaded at its upper end. At the base of this sleeve, a
membrane 14 in ?exible material having an acoustic
impedance similar to that of water, for example a natu
ral rubber, a silicone-containing elastomer or a polyure
thane, is bonded or attached by peening or in any other
manner.
The closed chamber bounded by the casing 110, 111,
the portions of the strip 112 corresponding to the win
dows 1110 to 1113 and membrane 113 contains a ?uo
rine-containing liquid the density of which is, for exam
ple, about double that of water, while the speed ofprop
agation of ultrasonic waves therein is for example half
its velocity ofpropagation in water; the result is that the
acoustic impedance of such a liquid is virtually the same
as that of water.

The closed chamber bounded by the bush 12, the
sleeve 13 and the membrane 14 contains water.
The portions of the strip 112 corresponding to the
windows 1110 to 1113, extremely ?exible, distort in
order to give a permanent pressure equilibrium between
the two chambers. The result is that the distorsion of the
membrane 14 when it is applied to the skin ofthe patient
produces no deformation of the membrane 113.
In the special liquid contained in the principal cham
ber, one can immerse with advantage a cavity 114 ?lled
with air closed by a ?exible membrane and of which the
changes in volume according to the temperature of the
liquid will compensate for the pressure variation ex
erted by this.
The membrane 113 can be given a certain curvature
and constitute for example, together with the liquid it
contains, a converging lens serving to focus the ultra
sonic beam. It would of course also be possible to glue
a separate acoustic lens, of a type well known in itself,
to the membrane 113.
It is self-evident that various modi?cations may be
made to the arrangements described and shown, with
out departing from the spirit of the invention.
We claim:
1. An ultrasonic probe comprising an elongated cas
ing containing a couplant liquid and ?tted at one end
