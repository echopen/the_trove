Check for Samples: TX810
1FEATURES DESCRIPTION
2• Compact T/R Switch for Ultrasound The TX810 provides an integrated solution for a wide
range of ultrasound applications. It is an 8 channel,
• Flexible Programmability
current programmable, transmit/receive switch in a
– 8 Bias Current Settings
small 6mm × 6mm package.
– 8 Power/Performance Combinations
The internal diodes limit the output voltage when high
– Easy Power-Up/Down control
voltage transmitter signals are applied to the input.
• Fast Wake Up Time While the insertion loss of TX810 is minimized during
receive mode.
• Dual Supply Operation
• Optimized Insertion Loss Unlike conventional T/R switches, the TX810 contains
a 3-bit interface used to program bias current from
7mA to 0mA for different performance and power
APPLICATIONS
requirements. When the TX810 bias current is set as
• Medical Ultrasound
0mA (i.e., high-impedance mode), the device is
• Industrial Ultrasound
configured as power-down mode. In the
high-impedance mode, TX810 does not add
additional load to high-voltage transmitters. In
addition, the device can wake up from power-down
mode in less than 1µs. With these advanced
programmability features, significant power saving
can be achieved in systems.

THEORY OF OPERATION
A typical ultrasound block diagram is shown in Figure 13.
Figure 13. Ultrasound System Block Diagram
A transducer is excited by high voltage pulsers. It converts the electrical energy to mechanical energy. After each
excitation, the transducer sends out ultrasonic wave to medium. Partial ultrasonic wave gets reflected by
inhomogeneous medium and received by the transducer again, i.e. echo signal. Thus, the transducer is a duplex
device on which both high voltage and low voltage signals exist. The transducer can not be connected to
amplifier stages directly; otherwise, the high voltage signal can permanently destroy amplifiers. The TX810, i.e.
T/R switches, is sitting between integrated HV pulser and low noise amplifier (LNA). The main function of TX810
is to isolate the LNA from high-voltage transmitter. TX810 limits the high voltage pulse and let echo signals
reaching amplifier. Therefore, an ideal T/R switch should completely block high voltage signals and maintain all
information from echoes.
The detail architecture of the TX810 is listed in Figure 14.

Figure 14. TX810 Block Diagram
TX810 includes four parts: Diode Bridge, bias network, clamp diodes, and logic controller. A decoder is used to
convert 3-bit logic (B1 to B3) input to 7 control signals (D0 to D6) for 7 MOSFET switches. +2.5V to +5V logic
input is level shifted internally to drive the switches. The bias current of the bridge diode is adjusted
proportionally by these switches. When all switches are on, the bias current is 7mA. Each bit difference will
adjust the bias current approximately 1mA. When all switches are off, the TX810 enters the power down mode.
Comparing to discrete T/R switches, TX810 can be shut down and turned on quickly as shown in the typical
characteristics plots. Considering the low duty cycle of ultrasound imaging, significant power saving can be
achieved.
All 6 diodes are high-voltage Schottky diodes to achieve fast recovery time. Following the bridge, a pair of
back-to-back diode limits the output voltage of TX810 to about 2Vpp. Different power/performance combination
can be selected by users. The TX810 is specified to operate at ±5V and VB is biased at 0V. The characteristics
of the T/R switch are mainly determined by bias currents. Lower power can be achieved with lower supply
voltages. Also, Table 1 shows the relationship among bias current, insertion loss, input noise, power
consumption and equivalent resistance.

APPLICATION INFORMATION
Similar to discrete T/R switch solutions, external components can be used to optimize system performance.
Inductor L and resistor RLOAD before the low voltage receiver amplifier (LVRx) can improve overload recovery
time and reduce reflection. The L acts as a high pass filter thus overshoot or recovery response spikes can be
suppressed to minimal. The L and RLOAD terminate the entire signal path and can reduce reflection; therefore
axial resolution in ultrasound image might be improved. However, the combined impedance of L and RLOAD may
affect the system sensitivity. The insertion loss of T/R switch is determined by the input impedance of receiver
amplifier and RON of the TX810. L also creates a DC path for any offset caused by mismatching.The inductor can
be as low as 10s µH to suppress low frequency signals from transmitter, transducer, multiplexer, and TX810. The
optimization of L and RLOAD is always an important topic for system designers. AC coupling are typically used
between transmitter and T/R switch or T/R switch and amplifier. Thus amplifiers with DC biased inputs will not
interference with T/R switch.
One challenge for integrating multiple channel circuits on a small package is how to reduce cross talk. In
ultrasound systems, acoustic cross talk from adjacent transducer elements is a dominant source. The cross talk
from transducer elements is in a range of -30 to -35dBc for array transducers. Circuit cross talk is usually at least
20dB better than the transducer cross talk. The special considerations were implemented in both TX810 design
and layout. The cross talk among TX810 channels is reduced to below -60 dBc as show in the specification

In ultrasound Doppler applications, modulation effect in system can influence image quality and sensitivity.
Ultrasound system is a complex mixed-signal system with all kinds of digital and analog circuits. Digital signals
and clock signals can contaminate analog signals on system level or on chip level. Nonlinear components, such
as transistors and diodes, can modulate noise and contaminate signals. In Doppler applications, the Doppler
signal frequency could range from 20Hz to >50KHz. Meanwhile, multiple system clocks are also in this range,
such as frame clock, image line clock, and etc. These noise signals could enter chip through ground and power
supply pins. It is important to study the power supply modulation ratio (PSMR) at chip level. Noise signal with
certain frequency and amplitude can be applied on supply pins. Side band signals could be found if modulation
effect exists. The PSMR is expressed as an amplitude ratio between carrier and side band signals. Beside
PSMR, 3rd order intermodulation ratio (IMD3) is a standard specification for mixed-signal ICs. Users can use
IMD3 to estimate the potential artifact Doppler mirror signals. Both specs can be found in the specification table.
The schematic of the basic connection for TX810 is shown in Figure 15. Optional inductors and resistors can be
used at TX810 outputs depending on transducer characteristics as discussed above. Standard decoupling
capacitors 0.1µF should be placed close to power supply pins. The pin out of TX810 is optimized for PCB layout.
All signals are going from left to right straightly.
