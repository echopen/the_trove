ULTRASONIC SENSING APPARATUS
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The invention relates to the ?eld of ultrasonic imag
ing, and in particular to ultrasonic imaging heads with
rotating transducers.
2. Prior Art
In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on
the use of ultrasonics to provide anatomical images of
soft body tissue. This emphasis, to some extent, resulted
from a public awareness of the dangers of x-rays, and
also from the technical advances made in electronics. In
the latter category, currently available integrated cir
cuit memories, microprocessors, etc., have made possi
ble the processing ofsignals which would not have been
attempted a decade ago.
Numerous ultrasound scanners are commercially
available which include a scanning head which is
brought in contact with the human body. One or more
ultrasound transducers transmit pulses of ultrasound
and then sense the echoes which are displayed or re
corded. High quality images are obtained, particularly
where relatively large imaging heads are used. In many
applications, however, smaller imaging heads are re
quired to scan certain tissue. For example, a smaller
imaging head or apparatus is required to view under the
ribs for gall bladder images or to examine thyroid tissue.
One apparatus currently employed for scanning these
more difficult regions includes a plurality of transducers
which are rotated about a common axis where each
transducer sequentially scans the body. A problem asso
ciated with this device (caused by reverberations) is
described in conjunction with FIG. 1. A typical trans
ducer with this con?guration is described in US. Pat.
No. 4,149,419.
As will be seen, the present invention provides an
imaging head employing a plurality of transducers ar
ranged in an off-axis con?guration. This con?guration
eliminates the reverberation problems found in prior art
devices.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
An ultrasound sensing apparatus for scanning the
human body is described. The apparatus includes a
rotating member having an axis of rotation. A plurality
of ultrasonic transducers, each having a beam axis along
5

which ultrasound is transmitted and received, are
mounted for rotation on the rotating member. Each of
the beam axes of these transducers are mounted such
that they do not intersect the axis of rotation of the
member. These beam axes lie in a common plane per
pendicular to this axis of rotation. As the transducers
are rotated, their beam axes sequentially cross a mem
brane or window which is in contact with the body.
Because of the off-axis mounting of these transducers on
the rotating member, the beam axes are not normal to
thebody when they are activated. This substantially
eliminates the reverberation problems associated with
similar prior art imaging devices.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
INVENTION
An ultrasonic sensing apparatus or imaging head
suitable for human body scanning and particularly suit
able for scanning body areas requiring a small imaging
head is disclosed. In the following description, numer
ous speci?c details, such as speci?c frequencies, etc., are
set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding
of the present invention. It will be obvious to one skilled
.in the art that the invention may be practiced without
these speci?c details. In other instances, well-known
devices and components are not described in detail in
order not to obscure the present invention in unneces
sary detail.
Referring ?rst to FIG. 1, in a typical prior art imag
ing head, a plurality of transducers are' mounted for
rotation within a housing 10. The transducers 11, 12 and
13 are mounted for rotation about the axis 14. The beam
axis for each of the transducers, that is, the axis along
which transmission and reception occur, passes through
the axis of rotation. For example, the axis 17 for the
transducer 13 intersects the axis of rotation 14.
In this typical prior art device, the transducers are
each sequentially activated as they rotate by the win
dow 18. The window is in contact with the body. When
the beam axes of these transducers are normal to the
body or window, or substantially normal to the body or
window, echoes occur from this interface which are
sensed by the transducer. As shown in FIG. 1, for the
position of transducer 11, ultrasound 15 from the trans
ducer 11 is reflected at the interface, causing the echo
16.‘ The sound 16 is re?ected from the face of the trans
ducer 11 and again rebounds from the interface. This
continuing rebounding causes periodic artifacts in the
observed image. Note that this problem of reverbera
tions occurs when the transducer 11 is in a normal or
substantially normal position with respect to the inter
face. In the other positions, the re?ections from the
interface are not directed back to the transducer.
To solve this problem in the prior art, often the ech
oes associated with the ?rst few centimeters beyond the
interface are ignored to eliminate the echoes from the
?rst interface rebound. This has the obvious problem
that tissue near the skin cannot be scanned. In some
instances, the transducers are mounted at a distance
from the interface greater than the maximum body
depth which is to be scanned. When this is done, the
echoes from body tissue are received before the second
rebound, thus eliminating the reverberation problem
except for the ?rst rebound. However, this approach
requires a relatively large imaging head which is un
suited for certain types of scanning, such as under the
ribs or for scanning the thyroid.

Referring now to FIG. 2, the invented imaging head,
in its presently preferred embodiment, is contained
within a generally cylindrical housing 22 which in
cludes a hemispheric shaped window or membrane 24
for contacting the body. With this shape, the membrane
24 may be readily urged onto the body for scanning
more dif?cult regions.
As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the imaging head in
cludes a rotating member 37 having an axis of rotation
40 on which the ultrasound transducers 26, 27 and 28
are mounted. The rotating member 37 is driven through
a belt drive from a motor 43. The position of the mem
ber 37 as it rotates is indicated by the mechanical encod
ing device 42 which is driven in synchronous with the
rotating member 37.
Each of the transducers includes a beam axis along
which it transmits and received ultrasound. The beam
axis 34 for the transducer 26 is illustrated for discussion
purposes. The transducers are mounted such that their
beam axes are offset or spaced-apart from the axis of
rotation 40. Unlike the prior art of FIG. 1 where the
beam axes cross the axis of rotation, note that the beam
axis 34 does not intersect the axis of rotation 40. In the
presently preferred embodiment, all of the beam axes lie
in a common plane which is perpindicular to the axis of
rotation 40. Also, the transducers are evenly spaced
about the axis 40 and for the embodiment employing
three transducers, they are spaced apart (from each
other) by 120°.
Rubber baf?es are mounted on the rotating member
37 adjacent to the non-active end of each of the trans
ducers. For example, the baf?e 30 is disposed opposite
the face 35 ofthe transducer 26. Similarly, the baf?es 31
and 32 are disposed adjacent to the non-active ends of
the transducers 27 and 28, respectively. These baf?es
are employed to reduce the transmission of unwanted
ultrasound within the imaging head. ‘
In the presently preferred embodiment, the window
or membrane 24 is hemispheric in shape and has its
radius originating on the axis 40. A semi-rigid mem
brane having a thickness of approximately g the wave
length of the ultrasound is employed. Also in the pres
ently preferred embodiment, the volume de?ned by the
housing 22 and membrane 24 is liquid-?lled. For a dis
cussion of the membrane thickness and accoustic prop
erties of the liquid, see co-pending application Ser. No.
925,701 ?led July 18, 1978, and now US. Pat. No.
4,231,373 entitled, “ULTRASONIC IMAGING AP
PARATUS”, and assigned to the assignee of the pres
ent invention.
In the presently preferred embodiment, commercially
available transducers are employed having a diameter
of approximately 13 mm and a center frequency of
approximately 3.5 MHz. A pulse rate of approximately
3 KHz is used. The transducers are rotated at approxi
mately 6.6 revolutions per second within the liquid
?lled housing.
As is well-known, the transducers are sequentially
activated as each of their beam axes cross the membrane
24. Thus, for example, for the positions of the transduc
ers shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, transducer 26 is activated
and transducers 27 and 28 are off. As rotation continues,
then transducer 28 is activated, and so on. In the pres
ently preferred embodiment, where three transducers
are employed, each transducer is activated when it is in
the position of transducer 26 (—90° from axis 39). The
transducers are deactivated at approximately 15° be‘
15
30
35
65
4
yond the axis 39. Thus, there is approximately 45° of
“dead-time” in each rotation of the rotating member.
Importantly, it should be noted that because of the
offset con?guration of the transducers, the beam axes of
the transducers are never normal or substantially nor
mal to the interface of the imaging head and the body.
Note, for example, that the beam axis 34 is not normal
or perpendicular to the membrane 24, nor will it be as it
rotates about the axis 40. This is in sharp contrast to the
prior art illustrated in FIG. 1 where each of the trans
ducers for the position shown by transducer 11 is nor
mal to the interface. By having the offset con?guration
as illustrated, echoes from the interface are directed
away from the receiving face of the transducers. For
example, as shown by echo 46 of FIG. 4, the sound
returned from the interface is directed away from the
receiving face 35 of the transducer 26 and, to a large
extent, is absorbed by the baffle 31.
The echoes received from the transducers may be
processed in any one of a number of well-known ways
to produce visual images of the body tissue.
. In the presently preferred embodiment, a program
mable read-only memory (PROM) 45 shown in FIG. 3
is used as a calibration device. The encoder 42 provides
a digital signal indicating the instantaneous angular
position of the rotating member 37. From this informa
tion the expected position of the beam axis of each of
the transducers is known. However, the beam axes of
these transducers are seldom in alignment with the
transducer body. Typical speci?cations for commer
cially available transducers indicate a tolerance of i 1°
for the difference between the actual beam axis and the
central axis of these transducers. The PROM 45 is pro
grammed after the transducers are mounted on the ro
tating member 37. As the rotating member is rotated,
the actual position of the beam axis is noted and com
pared to the angular position of the member 37. This
data is stored within the PROM 45. The output of the
encoder 42 is used to address the PROM, that is, to seek
out the data in a particular location with the PROM 45.
Stored at this location is the actual beam location which
is provided as an output signal from the PROM 45.
Thus, after the manufacturing of each of the imaging
heads, a PROM is programmed which acts as a calibra
tion means for that particular head.
While in the presently preferred embodiment three
transducers are employed, other numbers of transducers
may likewise be employed which are offset from the
axis of rotation. In FIG. 5, a housing 50 is shown which
includes a membrane 51. A rotating member 58 which
rotates about the axis 57 includes a pair of evenly spaced
transducers 53 and 54. Again, the beam axes of these
transducers, such as axis 56 of transducer 54, are offset
from the axis 57. The beam axes of the transducers in
this embodiment again lie in a common plane which is
perpendicular to the axis 57. It should be noted that
when fewer transducers are employed, more “dead
time” occurs.
In FIG. 6, another embodiment is illustrated with an
L-shaped housing. The housing 63 includes a handle
section 65 and a membrane 64. For purposes of illustra
tion, two transducers are shown offset on the rotating
member 64 which is driven by the motor 66. Also, an
encoder 62 is illustrated in this embodiment. For some
body areas, having the membrane at a right angle to the
handle provides‘ for easier scanning.
, Thus, an imaging head has been described which
employs a plurality of rotating transducers. By offset
4,269,066

ting these transducers from their axis of rotation, the
ultrasound propagating to and from the transducer face
is never perpendicular to the body/head interface. This
eliminates the reverberation problems common with
prior art devices.
