What is a
1-3 Piezo Composite?
1-3 Piezo Composites have become the
material of choice for many high perfor-
mance ultrasound transducer since
invented by R.E. Newnham and L.E. Cross in
the late1970's .
A variety of piezocomposite materials can
be made by combining piezo ceramic
elements with a polymer. Piezo composites
are classified according to their connectivi-
ty, defined as the number of dimensions
through which the material is continuous.
It is conventional for the first digit to refer
to the piezoelectrically active phase.
Prof. Newnham defined the family of
interconnectivity of piezo electric compos-
ites as shown in the schematics. Today, the
majority of piezo composites on the
market are with the 1-3 and 2-2 connec-
tivity used in ultrasound transducers,
actuators and sensors.
Piezo composite materials offer additional
design parameters over bulk piezo ceram-
ics. Major acoustic parameters such as
acoustic impedance, bandwidth, receiver
sensitivity or electric source capacitance
can now be easily adjusted by combining
different piezo ceramic and polymer mate-
rials with different fill factors.
Furthermore, due to the uniaxial dimen-
sions of the piezo electric material, phase
lateral clamping effects, sometimes
referred to as lateral modes, can be
minimized which allows for much higher
coupling coefficients compared with
monolithic transducer elements.

Arrange & Fill Technology
Piezo Fiber Composites
Smart Material manufactures piezo
electric 1-3 composites using up to
150mm long piezo fibers as active
rods.
Our piezo ceramic fibers are manu-
factured using a textile spinning
process.
Next the 1-3 piezo fiber composites
are prepared by epoxy infiltration of
fiber bundles and cutting of the
plate-shaped slices perpendicular
to the direction of the fibers. This
unique and patented method is also
called Arrange & Fill.
Due to this special manufacturing
process the Arrange & Fill tech-
nology offers both a random fiber
distribution as well as composite
elements with a regularly distribut-
ed fiber pattern.
The overview in the table below lists
the most common combinations of
the various fiber diameters,
frequency range, fill factor and type
of rod distribution.
All composites are available either
in Ceramtec’s SP505 or SP53 piezo
ceramic material.

Smart Material utilizes the Dice&Fill
method as the second production line to
manufacture 1-3 composites.
Currently, the Dice&Fill method is the
industry standard for manufacturing 1-3
piezo composites. For more than 3
decades now, Dice&Fill methods have
mainly been used for frequencies above
1MHz, especially for medical ultrasound
and NDT, including phased arrays for
imaging transducers. 1-3 Dice&Fill piezo
composites are prepared by dicing a
piezoceramic plate into an orthogonal
array, cutting 80%-90% into the plate
thickness. The pitch (distance between
rods) must be very small.
For a 5MHz resonance frequency, for example, it
is typically near 100um to avoid lateral and
grating modes The kerfs or trenches are filled
with an epoxy or other polymer material. After
the interstitial material has cured, the uncut
side of the ceramic is grinded down to the rod
structure and the thickness is adjusted to the
desired resonance frequency. This yields a regu-
lar pixel or rod distribution, which is required
for phased array ultrasound transducers.Dice&-
Fill composites are available in APC’s 840, 850
or CTS 3203HD piezo ceramic materials.
Advanced Ultrasound
Transducers & Arrays
3D shaped elements transducer casting and housing broadband transducers
Manufacturing of complex ultrasound transducers elements
The unique capabilities of the Arrange &
Fill technology, featuring fiber length
(rod) off up to 150mm, enables us to
manufacture complex, 3-dimensional,
and even curved transducer elements.
Smart Material’s fully equipped,
in-house workshop can handle most
any shapes that our customers request.
At Smart Material we provide a
complete vertical manufacturing service
for complex ultrasound transducers.
This includes piezo composite element
production, machining of backing and
matching layers, assembling of the final
water proof casting or housing of the
transducer.
Smart Material also offers the develop-
ment, production and assembly of
suitable backing and matching materials
for our piezo composite materials.
This enables an increased bandwidth
and reduces insertion losses into the
target medium.
Highly sensitive sonar systems require
both multiple elements arranged as an
array and a composite design that
allows for an elastic deformation due to
the incoming pressure wave.
At Smart Material we use micro spheres
filled polymers in combination with a
sophisticated assembling to meet these
product requirements successfully.
Furthermore, Smart Material is able to
provide complex assembling services for
array modules in a plane or curved
configuration. In cooperation with our
customers we develop suitable technol-
ogies, manufacturing tools and offering
innovative wiring technologies which
are often used in other in-house prod-
ucts.
This is especially useful very low
frequency applications, most of which
often require transducer designs that
are typically incompatible with design
space or voltage limitations of the
amplifiers. As a result Smart Material
also offers new composite material
approaches (2-2 composite) to increase
the overall efficiency of low frequency
applications.

PZT fibers (Arrange & fill Technology) do not achieve full bulk material properties due to the fiber manufacturing process and the
small dimensions. PZT fibers normally achieve between 65% to 75% of typical bulk material characteristics.

We offer Copper-Tin (CuSn), Gold (Au) or Silver (Ag) electrodes for our 1-3 composites. All electrodes are
applied using a vacuum deposition process and range between 700nm and 1.2 µm in thickness.Our standard
electrode is the copper-tin electrode which combines cost effectivness with electrical properties similar to
gold. Soldering wires to CuSn is much easier compared to gold. Our CuSn-electrode is about 1µm thick with
a 500 nm tin-coating as a protective layer to prevent the copper from corroding.
Most customers report successful soldering of wires to the 1-3 composites using a low temperature solder.
Special care should be taken when soldering on a 1-3 composites due to the fact that a considerable area of
the composite under the electrode is made of plastic. If the solder iron is too hot or applied too long, the plas-
tic will become soft and the bonding with the sputtered electrode material will fail causing the electrode to
come off.
Because of this, special attention should be taken to minimize the contact time between the composite and
solder bit. We recommend using a lead-free solder wire with temperatures around 270°C and a contact time
less than 0.5 seconds.
If you can not attach the wire to the composite in the first attempt, please give the composite some time to
cool down, otherwise this spot will become over-heated and the electrode will fail.
Skin the wire from its insulation, plate the stripped length with tin. Use some flux, e.g. "Fludor" to cover the
wire tip, take a drop of liquid tin with the solder bit, hold the wire to the solder bit contact the electrode
with both solder bit and wire, remove solder bit, keep wire on electrode, do not apply any loads until the tin
has cooled. We recommend the following Materials.
Flux: Alpha-Grillo "Fludor"
Wires: stranded, 0,06...0,14 sq.mm or enameled copper wire
Solder wire: leadfree FLUITIN 1532 per ISO 12224-1/1.12,
alloy SAC305 of Cookson Electronics/Alphametals
Dice-and-fill technique has been around for many years and is more expensive than the arrange-and-fill
method used by Smart Material.
Essentially, dice-and-fill begins with a bulk block of PZT, many grooves are diced using a diamond saw, and
the grooves are filled with polymer. The extensive cutting is the primary factor in driving up manufacturing
cost.
With arrange-and-fill, long strands of fibers are arranged randomly on end, and polymer is poured around
them forming a large block of piezo composite. This block can then be diced into different length pieces
according to the frequency desired. This translates into a faster, more cost-effective process.
Yes, you can by using a conductive glue for attaching wires to the composites.
Conductive glues allow for a reliable way to connect wires to our 1-3 composites, with comparable and
better adhesion as standard soldering.
We recommend the following glues from Epoxy Technology (www.epotek.com):
Epo-Tek 430, Epo-Tek H20E, Epo-Tek EE 129-4.
