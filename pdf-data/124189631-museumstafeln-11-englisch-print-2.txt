Twodimensional B-scanning
Mechanical Systems
Compound-scanning
Compound-scanning was the original way to
to create two-dimensional ultrasound images.
A single-element transducer was moved manually
in direct skin contact across the seletced
plane , in multiple directions by sweeping the
Probe repeatedly thru a certain sector.
Position and direction of the transducer
were calculated using position encoders in the
scanning arm. The echoes were usually displayed
on a storage oscilloscope (static system).

Initially all echoes beyond a certain (adjustable)
threshold were displayed as uniform bright dots
(bistable system). Around 1973 , the gray scale
technique was introduced in compound scanners: the echoes were
displayed according to their strength.
Real time system, mechanically
The Vidoson 635 (Siemens) was the first
fast scanning machine (real time) developed by
R. Soldner. The ultrasound beams of rotating
transducers were reflected as parallel arranged
beams into the body using a parabolic mirror. An
image frequency of 15/sec as well as gray scale
capability enabled a dynamic examination.

For the following years mechanical sector probes
became stabdard in ultrasound diagnostics. Even
today this method is beeing used for particular
applications.As an example the sector scanner Combison 100 (Kretz, 1977)
used 5 rotating transducers. Always the transducer passing the window
(directed to the body) was activated by a magnet, forming a sector image.

simultaneously rotating transducers, to form a combined „large
