Notes 1) Contact rating-Product of the switching voltage and current should never exceed the wattage rating.
Contact Hamlin for additional load/life information.
2) Operate (inc. bounce) /Release Time-per EIA/NARM RS421A, diode suppressed coil.
3) Pull in Range-Contact Hamlin for tolerances available within this range.
4) Rating Sensitivity-The value at which contact ratings and operating characteristics are determined. Derating
may be required below this value.
5) Storage Temperature-Long time exposure at elevated temperature may degrade solderability of the leads.
