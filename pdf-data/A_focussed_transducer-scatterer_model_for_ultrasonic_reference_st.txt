INTRODUCTION
In ultrasonic NDE, spherically focussed transducers are often used because they possess
higher sensitivity and spatial resolution than conventional planar transducers [1]. A common
reference standard setup that can be used to obtain the effective radius, focal length, and
transduction efficiency of a spherically focussed probe is the immersion configuration shown
in Figure 1 where a scatterer of simple shape (such as a sphere or cylinder) is placed on the
axis of the transducer and the pulse-echo response measured. A model is developed here that
allows the use of this measured response to obtain the important transducer parameters. The
model is computationally efficient and the methods of characterization are directly analogous
to those that have been successfully used for planar probes [2].

THE MODEL
Planar transducers radiating into a fluid are normally modelled as a uniform piston
source using Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory [3]. O'Neil [4] has shown that the
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formulation can also be used for spherically focussed probes provided
that the probe is not too tightly focussed. In this case, the incident wavefield pressure, pillC,
produced by the transducer is given by (Figure 1):
pillC =-iOlpVo/2x i[eXP(ikr)!r]dS
where p is the density of the fluid, Ol is the frequency in rad/sec, and Vo is the (uniform)
velocity on the spherical surface S. At many wavelengths from the transducer surface, the
spherical wave term in Eqn. (1) behaves locally like a plane wave. Therefore, the incident
wave pressure in Eqn. (1) can be viewed as the superposition of suitably weighted plane
waves over the transducer surface. Similarly, at many wavelengths from the scatterer, the
scattered pressure wavefield, pscan, due to a plane wave of unit amplitude can be calculated,
once the far-field scattering amplitude A ~;~), is known, i.e.
(1)
(2)
where fj and!l.., are the incident and scattered wave directions, respectively. If we combine
Eqns. (1), (2) then by superposition the scattered pressure due to the focussed transducer can
be written explicitly as
pscan = -iOlpV)2xi A~;~)[exp(ikr)/r] [exp(ikrs)/rJdS (3)
In the reception process, the quantity that usually is measured is the voltage versus time, V,(t),
on an oscilloscope screen. If we let V,(Ol) be the frequency components of this received
voltage, then we assume that V,(Ol) is proportional to the average radial velocity received, i.e.
where ~(Ol) is an "efficiency" factor. The outward (from the transducer) radial velocity at
many wavelengths from the scatterer can be calculated from pscan as
and the average radial velocity, <vR >is given by
From Eqns. (3) - (5), therefore, we find
V,(Ol) = ik~(Ol)l2xS ficosaA~;~)

where the unit vectors ~;~ and the angle a are shown explicitly in Figure 2. Equation (7) is
the basis for our spherically focussed transducer model. However, because of the double
surface integrals present, this equation is not particularly suitable even for direct numerical
evaluations. Fortunately, the area elements dS, dSs• can be written in the forms [4]
dS =rdrd~/qo (Sa)
(8b)
where qo = 1- zIRo' with z being the axial location of the scatterer, Ro is the geometrical focal
length of the transducer, and ~ and ~s are angles measured in a plane perpendicular to the
z-axis (Figure 3). In these coordinates

is the angular averaged far-field scattering amplitude of the scatterer and re is the distance
from the scatterer to the transducer edge. Although Eqn. (9) still contains four integrations, it
is in a form considerably more convenient than Eqn. (7) since the angular averaged scattering
amplitude is a quantity that can be calculated explicitly in a number of important special
cases. For example, for a rigid cylinder of radius b placed with one of its flat ends
perpendicular to the transducer axis, we find, in the Kirchhoff approximation [5]:
[k sin a/o(kb sinas)J,(kb sin a) - k sin as
Similarly, for the front surface response of a rigid sphere of radius b in the Kirchhoff
approximation [5]:
«A >i'+,= bI2exp[-ikb"2+2cosajcoseJ

(12)
When these scattering amplitudes are slowly varying in e, es (which is often the case in not
too tightly focussed probes where Ro » a), then

where Ab.... is the "backscattered" scattering amplitude. Then the averages in Eqns. (11), (12)
become

for the cylinder, and
Ab... = (b/2)exp(-2ikb) (14b)
for the sphere, and the r, rs integrations can be done explicitly (cos U "" 1) to yield
(15)
In the paraxial approximation, Eqn. (15) is identical in fonn to that found by Thompson and
Gray [6]. A particularly useful feature of Eqn. (15) is that it can seNe as the basis for a
straightforward method to obtain experimentally the effective radius and focal length of the
transducer, as will be shown in the next section.
EFFECTIVE TRANSDUCER RADIUS AND FOCAL LENGTH
As Figure 4 illustrates schematically, the on-axis response of a scatterer in the wavefield
of a focussed probe consists of a maximum response and a preceding minimum. If the
locations of these maxima and minima on the axis, Zmo. and Zmin' respectively, are measured
experimentally then estimates of both the effective transducer radius and focal length can be
obtained as follows. First, from Eqn. (15) it can be shown that the location of the particular
minimum shown in Figure 4 occurs at

By placing Eqn. (16) into Eqn. (17), the latter equation can be rewritten in terms ofRo and
measurable quantities only. Symbolically, we can rewrite Eqn. (17) in the form
(16)
(17)
(18)
(19)
This non-linear equation can be solved iteratively for the best fit focal length, Ro, from
measured values of Zmin and Zmax at the frequency J. Using this value ofR., we can then find
the effective radius, a, from Eqn. (16) which can be written in the equivalent form, for
a» ')..., as
(20)
Amin et al. [7] recently have proposed another non-linear fitting routine to determine the
effective parameters R.,a. However, their method involves solving a rather complicated (and
possibly ill-behaved) non-linear least squares problem and uses fitting data taken both on- and
off-axis. In contrast, the above procedures uses only the discrete measured values, Zmin and
ZmaX' and only requires the solution of Eqn. (19), which can be done with a simple root solver.
Also, the above procedure is merely an extension of the methods previously used to determine
the effective radius of unfocussed probes [8].
Table 1 shows the results of this method for a typical commercially available focussed
probe (Panametrics V309, nominal radius = 0.25 inches, nominal focal length =4.0 inches,
"center" frequency - 5 MHz) using a 1/8" diameter steel sphere scanned along the transducer
axis. Effective radius and focal length values were calculated at the nominal "center"
frequency of the transducer (5 MHz) as well as at the "side" frequencies of 4 and 6 MHz. As

can be seen from Table 1, there is some variation of these effective parameters with
frequency. This same phenomena was noted previously by Amin et al. [7] for focussed
probes and by Chivers et al' [8] for planar transducers.
TRANSDUCER SYSTEM EFFICIENCY FACTOR
To completely characterize a spherically focussed transducer in a given ultrasonic setup,
it is necessary to also have a means to calculate the efficiency factor, ~(ro). Once the
equivalent parameters, Ro and a, are obtained, ~(ro) can be found by placing a scatterer, such
as a sphere, at the geometrical focus, i.e. z =Ro. Unfortunately, in Eqn. (9) (or, equivalently,
Eqn. (15», we cannot merely set z = Ro since these expressions lead to % indeterminant
fonns. However, if we introduce a new set of angular coordinates, x = cos8, y = cos 8, in
Eqn. (9), we find

Vr(ro) = 2xik~(ro)R:/S JJcosu «A >.>., rr,

which is now well-behaved even at z =Ro where we obtain
with

[A]e= Jo A sin8d8
Again, if A is slowly varying so that A~Ab... then Eqn. (22) simplifies even further and we
have

(23)
(24)
EitherEqn. (22) or Eqn. (24) can be used directly to find P(ro) once Vr(ro) andRo,a are
measured since the remaining tenns are easily calculated for simple scatterers and ~(ro) then
obtained by a division-like process using the concept of a Wiener filter [9]. Attenuation
corrections can also be included in this process if they are needed. Although we have not
carried out any efficiency calculations yet via these equations, they are similar to those we
have previously used for planar probes [9] and should be straightforward to employ.
CONCLUSIONS
We have described the model of a spherically focussed transducer/scatterer combination
that allows the effective radius, focal length, and efficiency factor of the probe to be
determined. The experimental Ro and a values were shown to be somewhat frequency
dependent-a result that we are currently trying to understand with the use of more
sophisticated models. Experimental efficiency factor calculations are also being conducted
with this model. The calibration/standards methods derived from this model are simple and
should be useful in a wide variety of practical applications.
