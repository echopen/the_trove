ECHOGRAPHIC PROBE WTIH SECTOR
SCANNING USING A TRANSDUCER CAPABLE OF
COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE
STRUCTURE TO BE EXAMINED
[0001] The invention relates to an echographic probe With
sector scanning using a transducer capable of coming into
contact With the structure to be examined.
[0002] It is notably but not exclusively applied to echog
raphy of eye structures.
[0003] Generally, it is knoWn that in opthalmology, 2-D
echography at 10 MHZ is used in current practice for
exploring the anatomy and pathologies of eye structures and
more particularly that of the posterior pole (retina, optical
nerve, vitreous).
[0004] The technique of the probes uses sector scanning,
With Which probes may be obtained of small siZes, com
paratively to bar probes.
[0005] In order to perform this type of scan, echographic
probes are used, including an open tubular casing in its front
portion and the inner volume of Which is divided into tWo
compartments by a sealed partition, i.e.:
[0006] a rear compartment Which extends on the side of
the bottom of the casing: this compartment comprises
motoriZation and poWer supply circuits for the control
and processing parts of the apparatus,
[0007] a front compartment adjacent to the aperture of
the casing, Which contains a mobile transducer as Well
as all or part of its actuation mechanism.
[0008] The aperture of the front compartment is usually
closed by a ?exible or hard sealed membrane, in order to
obtain a sealed interior space containing a coupling liquid
Which should have high transmissibility for ultrasonic
Waves.
[0009] This membrane Which is intended to come into
contact With the eye of the patient, should be made in a
biocompatible material Which does not damp high frequency
ultrasound. lt con?nes the coupling liquid While alloWing
the eye to be protected from any accidental contact With
mechanical parts, i.e., notably the transducer and/or its
actuation mechanism. NoW, these are results Which are
dif?cult to obtain, Which explains the invention’s advantage
of reducing these problems to the making of the transducer
itself, i.e., at the source of ultrasound, so as to be able to act
more easily on the global features of the transducer.
[0010] Echographic apparatuses of this type nevertheless
prove to have a certain number of draWbacks. Indeed:
[0011] Before reaching the eye, the ultrasonic Wave
focused by the concave curvature of the pieZoelectric ele
ment of the transducer, has to pass through several layers of
material having different properties and this, With different
propagation velocities, the path of these Waves inside these
layers varying according to the (variable) position of the
transducer.
[0012] This causes variations in the focal length of the
transducer and inaccuracies in the obtained echographic
image.
[0013] Moreover, it is seen that in the case of a high
frequency transducer (from 15 MHZ), liquids and mem
Nov. 29, 2007
branes become increasingly absorptive. Consequently, the
frequencies Which effectively penetrate the tissues are much
less than the frequencies emitted by the transducer.
[0014] Thus, as an example, for a transducer emitting With
a frequency of 20 MHZ, the transmitted central frequency
Will be 18 MHZ With a loss of 10 dB.
[0015] Within the scope of open probes, all these draW
backs are suppressed since the coupling medium consists in
a Water bath Which has good acoustic properties. HoWever,
the transducer performs its motion at a very small distance
from the structure to be examined and even ifit has a circular
shape, its edges are aggressive and accordingly, it is not
possible to suppress any risk oftrauma by accidental contact
of the transducer With the eye (scratching of the cornea by
the circular edge of the transducer).
[0016] Accordingly, more particularly, the object of the
invention is to suppress these draWbacks.
[0017] For this purpose it proposes an echographic probe
With sector scanning comprising a tubular body at least
partially housed in its front end, a transducer designed so as
to emit an incident ultrasonic Wave focused in the direction
of the structures to be examined and to receive ultrasonic
Waves generated by these structures under the effect of this
incident Wave, this transducer being associated With actua
tion means so as to be able to perform displacements, at least
partially in rotation in order to obtain a sector scan of the
structures to be examined.
[0018] According to the invention, the transducer com
prises a pieZoelectric assembly having a poWer of focusing
emitted beams While having at its end, an axisymmetric
surface, the generatrix of Which has a curved shape and the
director axis of Which corresponds to the axis of rotation of
the transducer, this surface being intended to come into
contact With the structure to be examined. This curved shape
may be circular in order to obtain a toric shape or a spherical
shape.
[0019] By means of these arrangements, the presence of
any aggressive edge in the transducer portion Which may
come into contact With the eye is suppressed. The ?rst
problem of the open probes is thereby solved, as the trans
ducer Will no longer be a member capable of damaging the
eye and this, even in the case of a Wrong move by the
clinician. On the other hand, the material used is such that
it Withstands all decontamination protocols With soakings.
[0020] With the direct transducer/tissue-to-be-examined
contact, the aforementioned inaccuracies may be avoided.
Only the application of a gel on the tissues is required for
providing good transmission of ultrasound.
[0021] The frequencies Which effectively penetrate into
the tissues are actually those emitted by the transducer.
[0022] Embodiments of the invention Will be described
hereafter, as non-limiting examples, With reference to the
appended draWings Wherein:
[0023] FIG. 1 is an axial section ofa probe With a spherical
transducer;
[0024] FIG. 2 is a 90° axial section of the section illus
trated in FIG. 1;
US 2007/0276249 A1
[0025] FIG. 3 is a sectional vieW With a reduced scale of
a probe of the type shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 applied on the
eye of a patient;
[0026] FIG. 4 is a schematic illustration of an alternative
embodiment of the probe according to the invention.
[0027] In the example illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the
probe has a double-Walled tubular body, partly illustrated,
including an outer Wall 1, for example in stainless steel, and
an inner Wall 2, for example in plastic.
[0028] The inner Wall 2 delimits tWo successive compart
ments, i.e.:
[0029] a rear compartment 3, in Which is housed a
coaxial gear motor 4, the central shaft 5 ofWhich drives
into rotation a driving rotating plate 6 bearing a per
manent magnet 7, and
[0030] a front compartment 8, open at its end opposite
to the posterior compartment 3.
[0031] The separation betWeen both compartments 3, 8, is
provided by a spherical partition 9, obtained by molding or
machining With the inner Wall 2 and the concavity of Which
is directed toWards the front compartment 8. This spherical
partition 9 is found in the extension of an inner ?ange 10
forming a throat betWeen both chambers 3, 8.
[0032] The permanent magnet 7 housed in a cavity of the
rotating plate 6 has a cylindrical and frustro-conical shape
obliquely centered relatively to the drive axis 5 of the motor
4 and the large base of Which extends tangentially to the
spherical partition 9.
[0033] Inside the front chamber 8, a spherical transducer
11 is rotatably mounted, including a main supporting part 12
With a substantially cylindrical shape and a staged bore,
rotatably mounted on the inner Wall 2 by means of tWo
coaxial pins 13, 14, centered perpendicularly to the main
axis of the part 12. In this example, both pins 13, 14 are
borne by bearings mounted in coaxial cylindrical housings
provided in the inner Wall 2.
[0034] This main supporting part 12 comprises on one side
at a predetermined distance from the axis ofboth pins 13, 14,
a bore discontinuity delimiting a cavity open outWards in
Which a pieZoelectric assembly 15 is positioned, having a
outWard focusing poWer and its outer shape 20 of Which is
spherical.
[0035] On the side of the axis of the pins, opposite to the
element 15, the main supporting part forms a shell Which
delimits a cavity into Which a drive permanent magnet 17 is
engaged, having a spherical surface centered perpendicu
larly to the axis ofthe pins 13, 14, thereby ?tting to the shape
of the spherical partition 9.
[0036] On the lateral sides ofthe main supporting part 12,
Which extend parallel to the axis of the pins 13, 14, tWo
respective side magnets 18, 19 are attached (FIG. 2),
intended for cooperating With a Hall effect detector in order
to determine the angular position ofthe transducer 11. These
side magnets 18, 19 have an outer spherical shape concentric
With the transducer 11.
[0037] According to the invention, the front part of the
transducer 11 (located on the side of the pieZoelectric
element, relatively to the axis of the pins) is coated With a
Nov. 29, 2007
molded material layer 20 With high transmissibility for
ultrasonic Waves emitted by the pieZoelectric assembly 15.
[0038] In this example, this layer 20, Which has a spherical
outer surface coaxial With the transducer 11, stops at a height
of about 5° relatively to the equatorial plane of the trans
ducer 11. This layer 20 coats the transducer su?iciently so as
to provide contact With the structures to be explored during
the Whole rotation.
[0039] The seal betWeen the outer 7 and inner 2 Walls in
the vicinity of the ori?ce, is for example provided by a
elastomeric gasket 22 With a cylindrical shape including a
radial ?ange 23 directed toWards the inside, Which Will cover
the end ofthe inner Wall 2 in order to rest With its inner edge
on the spherical surface of the layer 20.
[0040] With this gasket 22, it is therefore possible to avoid
introduction of liquid or solid material inside the front
chamber 8 of the probe 11.
[0041] By means ofthe arrangements described earlier, by
supplying electrical energy to the motor 4, the rotary plate 6
and therefore the magnet is caused to rotate, the magnet
performing a circular trajectory around the longitudinal axis
of the probe in the immediate vicinity of the spherical
partition 9.
[0042] Under the effect of the rotating magnetic ?eld
generated by the magnet 7, the permanent magnet 17 is
subject to an attractive/repulsive force Which causes an
alternating rotary movement of the spherical transducer 11
around the axis of the pins 13, 14. The transducer 11
performs a sector scan, the angular position of Which is
detected by means of the action of the side magnets 18, 19
on the Hall effect detector.
[0043] The front part ofthe spherical transducer 11, Which
emerges from the ?ange 23 of the elastomeric gasket 22,
may be directly put into contact With the eye, as indicated in
FIG. 3. Only a slight gel layer may be applied on the eye to
provide good transmission ofultrasound and to improve the
sliding betWeen the eye and the spherical transducer.
[0044] Of course, the invention is not limited to the
embodiment described earlier.
[0045] Thus, for example, the probe 25 (FIG. 4) may
comprise a spherical transducer 26 rotatably mounted
around an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body
of the probe 25.
[0046] In this case, the pieZoelectric element 27 may be
centered perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the
transducer 26 as illustrated in FIG. 4.
[0047] In this case, the pieZoelectric assembly 27 is coated
in a spherical part 28 in a material providing proper trans
mission of ultrasonic Waves.
[0048] Driving the assembly 27 into rotation is here pro
vided by means of a motor 31 coaxial With the probe and the
output shaft thereof connected to the transducer by means of
a transmission component 32, provides the mechanical
attachment of the spherical part 28.
[0049] The electrical connection of the active component
is achieved by the screW connector 35 of the SMC or
equivalent type, accessible through the recessed portions of
the transmission element 32. A permanent magnet 29 facing
US 2007/0276249 A1
a Hall effect sensor 30 integral With the casing of the probe
25, enables the position information to be sent back to the
card 33 controlling the motor for an alternating reciprocal
movement.
[0050] Taking into account the fact that the angular sector
scanned by the transducer 27 is centered perpendicularly to
the axis of the probe 25, the front end of the body of the
probe 25 ends on one side as a slightly curved bevel so as
to delimit an oblique aperture and to expose the useful area
ofthe transducer 27 Which should be applied to the eye. The
advantage of this solution consists in that during echogra
phy, vision of the eye of the patient by the operator is only
very partially hidden by the probe 25 (only by its front end).
The hand Which holds the probe 25 Will be outside the ?eld
of vision, Which Was not the case in the example described
earlier.
[0051] Moreover, the movements ofthe transducer are not
limited to simple alternating rotational movements. Indeed,
these movements may be ofthe arc-shaped type. In this case,
the transducer may be mounted on an actuated device for
example of the type of the one Which is described in Patent
Application NO 02 05780 as of May 7, 2002, on behalfofthe
applicant.
[0052] In this case, the spherical shape of a transducer
provides considerable limitation of the risk of any accident.
