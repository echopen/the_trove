The Company
FERROPERM was registered in Denmark in May
1952 as a personal business to produce iron dust
cores, ferrites and ceramic capacitors. In 1955,
piezoelectric ceramics based on barium titanate were
added to the product range.
The business was transferred to a limited company,
”Industriselskabet Ferroperm A/S” in 1957. This
company steadily expanded its activities, and at a
time also comprised production of capacitors and
optical interference filters.
Since the formation of Ferroperm's Piezoelectric
Division in 1958, its turnover has increased by
approximately 15 % per year. In 1989 the
Piezoelectric Division moved to modern premises to
accommodate further expansion, and was turned into
a separate limited company in 1998.
After a short period under American ownership in the
year 2001, Ferroperm Piezoceramics A/S is now
owned by a group of the senior managers in the
company in partnership with a strong Danish
investment group.
New products have been continuously developed and
the Ferroperm product range today includes 6 types
of lead zirconate-titanate, PZT, suitable for a variety
of applications, a relaxor-based solid solution
optimized for medical imaging, bismuth titanate, for
use at elevated temperatures, modified lead titanate
and lead metaniobate, with high anisotropy, and an
electrostrictive material, lead magnesium niobate,
PMN.
Finally, for special applications, "HIP Quality" very
low porosity ceramics can be obtained in some of the
above materials.
Research and Development
Ferroperm has a long standing commitment to R&D
and currently spends approximately 20 % of its
turnover on R&D projects. There is a close
collaboration with leading universities throughout
Europe. Ferroperm has continuously been involved in
large European projects under Brite/Euram, Eureka,
Cost, Esprit, FP5 etc.
Research topics include high-temperature piezo-
electric ceramics, high sensitivity materials, lead-free
materials, and thick-film technology.
Policy
More than 95 % of the products in Ferroperm
Piezoceramics A/S are custom made to meet
individual requirements of customers.
Our main focus throughout the entire production
process is to provide materials and components with
the highest possible reproducibility of properties and
parameters, and to obtain the lowest ageing rates in
the industry. This enables customers to optimize

Piezoelectric Materials
By definition, a piezoelectric material generates a
charge when put under pressure, and will show a
change in volume when an electrical field is applied. It
can be used as a transducer material for transforming
electrical energy into mechanical energy and vice
versa. Furthermore, applying an A.C. voltage to the
material will cause it to vibrate, and thus generate
mechanical waves with the same frequency as the
electrical voltage. Similarly, if a mechanical vibration
is applied, then a charge of proportional size and same
frequency will be generated.
History
Piezoelectric activity was first discovered in single
crystals by J. and P. Curie in 1880. However, it was
not until 1946 that scientists discovered that BaTiO3
ceramics could be made piezoelectric by application of
an electric field. This lead to the discovery of a number
of piezoceramics and to the Lead Zirconate Titanate
(PZT) family, in 1956. With its increased sensitivity
and higher operating temperature, PZT soon replaced
BaTiO3 in many existing devices and are still the most
widely used piezoceramics today.
The ceramic materials have several advantages over
single crystals, including; higher sensitivity (up to
several hundred times higher) and ease of fabrication
into a variety of shapes and sizes. In contrast, single
crystals must be cut along certain crystallographic
directions, limiting the possible geometrical shapes.
Applications
Piezoelectric ceramics are used in a broad range of
applications due to their excellent properties, such as
high sensitivity, ease of manufacture and the
possibility of poling the ceramic in any direction. A
few applications are listed below:
• Accelerometers.
• Flow meters: Blood, industrial processes, waste
water.
• Medical: Imaging, HIFU, IVUS, surgical knives,
and cleaning of blood veins.
• Underwater acoustics: echosounders, sonar
systems, fish-finders, seabed mapping.
• Industrial sensors based on ultrasound: Level
control, detection, and identification.
• Hydrophones: Seismic, biologic, military,
underwater communication.
• Inkjet printheads.
• Dental work: Removal of plaque.
• Alarm systems: Movement detectors, broken
window sensors.
• NDT: Transducers for Non Destructive Testing.
• Musical instrument pickups.
• Acoustic emission transducers.
• Actuators.
• Micro positioning devices: Optics, scanning
tunneling microscopes.
• Surface Acoustic Waves: Personal Computer touch
screens, filters.
• Welding and drilling of metals and plastics.

Piezoceramics
Piezoelectric ceramics are, after firing, composed of
small grains (crystallites), each containing domains in
which the electric dipoles are aligned. These grains
and domains are randomly oriented, so the net elec-
tric dipole is zero, i.e. the ceramics do not exhibit
piezoelectric properties.
The application of a sufficiently strong DC. field will
orient the domains in the field direction, as nearly as
the orientation of the crystal axes allows. This ability
to change the orientation of the domains and achieve
a net polarization is called ferroelectricity.
A remanent polarization can be created in ferroelectric
ceramics by polarization. After the poling process is
complete, a voltage with the same polarity as the pol-
ing voltage causes expansion along the poling axis and
contraction perpendicular to the poling axis. Compres-
sive or tensile forces applied to the ceramic element
will generate a voltage.
Definitions and Terminology
In piezoelectric ceramics, material characteristics de-
pend on the direction of the applied field, displace-
ment, stress and strain. Hence superscripts and sub-
scripts indicating the direction are added to the sym-
bols.
The direction of polarization is generally designated as
the z-axis of an orthogonal crystallographic system.
The axes x, y and z are respectively represented as 1, 2
and 3 directions and the shear about these axes are rep-
resented as 4, 5 and 6. This is shown schematically on
page 4. The various piezoelectric material constants
are generally expressed with subscripts using this no-
tation. Some examples are shown in the table on next
page. In addition to the above, planar modes are some-
times expressed with a subscript ´p´.
The first subscript gives the direction of the electrical
field associated with the voltage applied or the charge
produced. The second subscript gives the direction of
mechanical stress or strain.
Superscripts indicate a constant mechanical or electri-
cal boundary condition. The table below gives a gen-
eral description of the superscripts.
Parameter Symbol Condition
Stress T Mechanically free
Field E Electrical short circuit
Diel. displacement D Electrical open circuit
Strain S Mechanically clamped
Curie Temperature
The crystal structure of a material changes at the Curie
temperature, Tc, from piezoelectric (non-symmetrical)
to a non-piezoelectric (symmetrical) form. This phase
change is accompanied by a peak in the dielectric con-
stant and a complete loss of all piezoelectric properties.

Dielectric Constant
The relative dielectric constant is defined as the ratio of
the permittivity of the material to the permittivity of
free space. This is generally measured well below the
mechanical resonance. The dielectric constant is de-
rived from the static capacitance measurements at 1
kHz using a standard impedance bridge.

Dielectric Loss Factor
The dielectric loss factor is defined as the tangent of
the loss angle (tan δ). The loss factor represents the ra-
tio of conductance to susceptance of a parallel equiva-
lent circuit of the ceramic element. The loss factor can
be measured directly using an impedance bridge.
Mechanical Quality Factor
The mechanical quality factor is the ratio of the reac-
tance to the resistance in the series equivalent circuit
representing the piezoelectric resonator. The Qm factor
is also related to the sharpness of the resonance fre-
quency.

Elastic Compliances
Young’s modulus describes the mechanical stiffness
properties and is expressed as the ratio of stress to
strain. In a piezoelectric material, mechanical stress
produces an electrical response, which opposes the
resultant strain. The value of the Young’s modulus
depends on the direction of stress and strain and the
electrical conditions. The inverse of Young’s
modulus, Y, is the elastic compliance, s, which can
be calculates as follows (see relevant geometries on
page 5):

Ferroperm Piezoelectric Materials
10
Ferroperm manufactures piezoelectric ceramics in 5 material groups, traditional lead zirconate titanate (hard
and soft PZT), relaxor-based solid solutions, modified lead titanate, lead metaniobate and bismuth titanate. A
brief description of the materials is given below and material data can be found on pages 12 to 16.
Lead zirconate titanate (Soft).
Type Pz23 and Pz27. These materials are
characterized by relatively high Curie temperatures (>
350°C), low mechanical QM factor and high electrical
resistivity at elevated temperatures. Pz27 has a high
dielectric constant, high charge coefficients and high
electromechanical coupling coefficients.
Type Pz29 has a lower Curie temperatures, but high
dielectric constants, and high coupling coefficients.
Ceramics from these compositions are particularly
useful in for a wide spectrum of applications ranging
from combined resonant transducers for medical and
flow measurements to accelerometers, pressure
sensors, and NDT.
Lead zirconate titanate (Hard).
Type Pz24, Pz26 and Pz28. These materials are
characterized by high coercive field, high mechanical
QM factor and low dielectric loss. Pz24 has a very
low dielectric constant. Pz26 and Pz28 are both high
power and low loss materials.
Typical applications include underwater applications,
high voltage generators, high power ultrasonics, e.g.
cleaning, welding and drilling devices.
Relaxor-based solid solution
Type Pz21. This material is characterized by a very
high dielectric constant, high charge coefficient and
high electromechanical coupling coefficients.
Used primarily for medical imaging systems, i.e.
phased arrays and composites.
Modified lead titanate. Type Pz34 has large
electromechanical anisotropy, low dielectric constant
and properties and have extremely low grain size. It is
very stable over time, temperature and frequency.
Recommended for single element high frequency
medical transducers and applications where
interference from radial modes is a significant
problem.
Lead metaniobate. Type Pz35 is anisotropic, has a
low QM factor, low acoustic impedance, and low
dielectric constant.
Primarily used in NDT systems where low QM factor
and clean impulse response are required.
Bismuth titanate. Type Pz46 has a very high Curie
temperature (> 600°C) and working temperatures of
up to 550°C.
Used in high temperature applications, i.e.
accelerometers, flow-meters and pressure sensors.

The Manufacturing Process
17
The manufacturing process involves a number of
stages shown schematically in figures 1 to 12. The
first step is to weigh, dry mix and ball mill [2] the
raw materials. The uniform mixture is then heat
treated (calcined) [3], during which the components
react to form the polycrystalline phase. The calcined
powder is ball milled [4] to increase it' s reactivity,
and granulated [5], with the addition of a binder, to
improve its pressing properties.
After shaping by dry-pressing [6], the binder is
burnt out [7] by slowly heating the green ceramics
to around 700°C. The parts are transferred to
another furnace, where they are sintered [8] between
1200 and 1300°C. The dimensional tolerance of
fired parts (± 3 %) is improved by cutting, grinding,
lapping etc. [9].
Electrodes are applied either by screen printing or
by vacuum deposition [10]. Poling then is carried
out by heating in an oil bath at 130-220°C, and
applying an electrical field of 2-8 kV/mm to align
the domains in the material [11]. The oil bath is
used as a heat source and to prevent flash over.
Final inspection [12] is performed 24 hours later,
and includes testing of electrode-ceramic bonding as
well as measurement of dimensional tolerances, di-
electric and piezoelectric properties.

The electrode material is typically chemically plated
nickel-gold.
Shear Rings
Shear rings (opposite polarisation/electrode configu-
ration to shear tubes) are offered based on customer
specification. These can be specified with special
cuts, slots, or chamfering to aid assembly, and have
multiple output signals.
Electrodes are chemically plated nickel-gold or
evaporated silver or gold.

Soldering Procedure
Clean the area to be soldered thoroughly. Pre-tin the
electrode area and the lead. A low melting point
Sn/Pb solder containing 2 - 4 % silver is recom-
mended (Multicore LMP, FLUX 362).
Place the lead in the middle of the pre-tinned area,
applying a firm pressure, see figure 1 and 2. Heat
the lead a little above the ceramic surface. When the
solder on the lead melts, move the soldering iron
down the lead to ensure the melting of the solder on
the silver electrode. Withdraw the soldering iron as
soon as the solder has melted (5 - 7 seconds).
Soldering temperature should be approximately 270
- 300°C. Using too low a temperature will increase
soldering time. The right temperature is when the
solder melts readily. Care should be taken to use a
short soldering time as excessive heat could locally
depolarise the ceramic, or reduce the piezoelectric
properties.
Remove flux according to the recommendations of
the solder manufacturer. The electrodes will with-
stand ordinary ultrasonic cleaning processes.
Tolerances
A set of standard tolerances is used, if nothing else is
specified by the customer. This set is separated into
several different categories. For most of these catego-
ries the customer however have the opportunity to
specify other tolerances for the specific parameters,
which are most critical for that certain application.
Changes in inspection level should however always
be discussed with Ferroperm and incorporated into
the quotation and ordering as soon as possible in the
dialog.
The first step in approval of a new production is the
material itself, where a list of tolerances must be ful-
filled in order to qualify as one of the 10 materials in
the programme. A set of tolerances has therefore
been defined. These tolerances are also used to verify
any new material batches before it is released for
regular production.

For the specific production there will be a list of pa-
rameters regarding the size, geometrical parameters
and electric behaviour, which have to be fulfilled.

Finally other more subjective parameters will be
measured and documented when relevant. Among
these parameters are for example, internal cracks,
solderability, electrode adherence, surface rough-
ness, and edge resistance in wrap-around electrodes.

Quality Assurance and Standards
The quality system in Ferroperm ensures full trace-
ability for all productions and all operations carried
out on an order.
The starting point in the system is that all produc-
tions are performed material-batch-specific rather
than based on generic material data. This means,
that before any material is released for regular pro-
duction, a pilot production has been completed, and
all relevant parameters have been measured and ap-
proved. The data for a specific batch is saved in a
database, which is used by the production manager
to optimise the production parameters for each new
production.
The material batch number is therefore an important
parameter for every new production, and will be
clearly marked on both the production- and final in-
spection sheets.
As shown in previous sections, each production
have a number of different processes, which must be
performed before a certain part is completed. After
each of these operations the responsible operator
will record and register the time spent and the
quantity of defects generated.
The quality system differentiate between more than
120 different types of defects ranging from simple
errors on dimension to more complicated types,
such as discrepancies in certain piezoelectric pa-
rameters. By operating this highly differential sys-
tem, a more systematic approach to corrective ac-
tions can be taken.
After a completed production, all parts are passed
through the final inspection unit. This department is
a staff function under the managing director of Fer-
roperm Piezoceramics. Here qualified and well
trained personnel uses modern and periodically
calibrated equipment to verify that productions fulfil
the internal standards to the materials and the toler-
ances given by the customer.
Most control operations are based on the statistical
sampling described in Military Standard MIL-STD-
1050 (ISO 2602-1973). The acceptable quality limit,
AQL, is 0.65 - Sample plan 2. By operating this
system, it is secured that maximum 0,65% defect
parts can be sent to a customer without seeing any
problems during inspection.
In some cases customers have one or more critical
parameters, where defects cannot be tolerated in
spite of an increased cost of the parts. In such cases
Ferroperm offer a 100% inspection on these pa-
rameters.
Certificates of conformance and/or copies of the fi-
nal inspection sheets are supplied on request from
the customer.
Ordering Information
Submitting the following information when inquir-
ing for quotations will be helpful:
• Type of material
• Geometric shape, dimensions and tolerances
• Electrode material, pattern and polarization
• Quantities required
• Specification of the part if available
• Requested delivery date
• If part-deliveries from stock are required
Packaging and Shipping
Ferroperm uses packaging and shipping methods
that ensure safe delivery of products to the cus-
tomer. These methods are based on our experience
in shipping such materials. The shipping method is
usually chosen based on the most economical
method available. Special packaging and shipping
services are available on request.
Shipping damage must be reported to the transport
carrier immediately. Returns, if necessary, must be
arranged with Ferroperm to obtain return
authorisation and re-entry documentation.
