1.  About

echOpen is an open and collaborative project and community, led by a
multidisciplinary core of experts and senior professionals with the aim
of making open and freely available medical imaging technologies. The
goal is to design by 17 February 2016, a functional prototype of a
low-cost and open source echo-stethoscope (ultrasound probe) connected
to a smartphone, allowing the radical transformation of diagnostic
orientation in hospitals, general medicine and medically underserved
areas. This initiate is aimed for health professionals from southern and
northern countries.

How the project kick-started?
-----------------------------

echOpen was born as a community project gathering people interested in
m-health and e-health devices for the future of medicine.

After bringing together a core team of 4 people with essential expertise
for the project, we tested the feasibility (state of the art,
applications etc.). We then mobilized other profiles and partners to
create an operational community based on 9 specific challenges we
identified that cover the entire project. As each participant has
various interests and capacities of engagement and expertise, we
co-created a project schedule in accordance with these different
elements. Using a wiki, which assembles all information (technical,
processes, supports, etc.), contributors are able to quickly take on
global challenges or specific issues and bring solutions according to a
detailed development plan and their availabilities.

Some key partners brought resources such as finance, equipment, working
spaces, etc. to support the effort and to reach project goals.

Outcomes (september 2015)
