1.  A short take on interfaces

**[Transducer](:Category:Transducer "wikilink")**
-------------------------------------------------

-   **Objective**
    -   Getting a good-resolution signal from a robust transducer, which
        may or may not include the following specs:
        -   Immersible
        -   With a focal distance of 75mm
        -   10mm in diameter (it seems that smaller have smaller
            focal distance)
        -   Materials : possibility to use 1-3 composite
        -   if possible, low-cost !
-   **Requirements**
    -   Getting a « top » to pulse
    -   As short as possible
    -   As high voltage as possible (within specs)
-   **Tests with [ Emile](:Category:Emile "wikilink")**
    -   How we got the [First Pulses (Sept.
        2015)](First_Pulses_(Sept._2015) "wikilink")
    -   and subsequently the [First Echoes (Sept.
        2015)](First_Echoes_(Sept._2015) "wikilink")
    -   Produced our first transducer
