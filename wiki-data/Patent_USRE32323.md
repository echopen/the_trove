Abstract
========

An examination of the human heart is carried out by means of ultrasound
waves emitted by piezo-electric crystals. The crystals are inserted in a
holder adapted to be placed on the body of a patient; they are arranged
in a row and have parallel axes of radiation. The crystals are
cyclically excited at a high scanning frequency, and the echo signals
reflected by the heart walls and received by the crystals are displayed
on the screen of a cathode ray tube to obtain a cross-sectional picture
of the heart. In a modification of the invention, the holder comprises
two or more rows of crystals radiating at different angles; in this case
the echo signals related to a common point of the heart wall are
superposed on the screen of the cathode ray tube by means of a
coordinate transformation.
