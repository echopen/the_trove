Abstract
========

A servo-control apparatus for use with equipment having a servo feedback
loop, comprising an electrically energized light-emitting means or lamp,
a control photosensitive device having an expansive sensing surface
exposed to a portion of the light from said light-emitting means, and a
movable light-control member disposed in the path of said light to
controllably intercept portions thereof and thus produce defined
shadowed and illuminated areas on the said sensing surface. A
compensating circuit is provided, for maintaining constant the output
response of the control photosensitive device for various given fixed
positions of the movable light-control member. The compensating circuit
includes a second or compensating photosensitive device which is
positioned out of the path of light intercepted by the movable member so
as to receive continuous light or excitation from the lamp. This circuit
further includes an amplifier having its input connected to the
compensating photosensitive device and having its output connected to
the lamp to thereby control the intensity of the latter. The
compensating circuit operates to maintain constant the output response
of the control photosensitive device for given fixed positions of the
movable member by balancing out changes which would normally occur in
said output response due to such things as temperature drift, aging of
both the lamp and the control photosensitive device, etc. The
compensating circuit also operates to balance out changes in the output
response of the control photosensitive device due to variations in the
light transmission medium, such as could arise from lens fogging, or the
settling of dust or debris on the lamp surface.
