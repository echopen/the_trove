What do we want to do, and the different logic components of the probe.

The logic parts can be found on the probes we have been exploring, for example the [[IR1510AK]] , the [[S-VRW77AK]] with the transducers we are using on the V0.0 or on the [[A6-3]] and its annular array.

== '''[[:Category:Emission|Emission]]''' ==
*'''Objective'''
**Sending a 1 – 2µs pulse at minus 150V to get the pulse.
*'''Requirements'''
**Getting a « top » to pulse
**As short as possible
**As high voltage as possible (within specs)
*'''Tests with [[:Category:Emile | Emile]]'''
*** The first steps for Emile were described at [[Le Développement Electronique]]

== '''[[:Category:Transducer|Transducer]]''' == 
*'''Objective'''
**Getting a good-resolution signal from a robust transducer
*'''Requirements'''
**Getting a « top » to pulse
**As short as possible
**As high voltage as possible (within specs)
*'''Tests with [[:Category:Emile | Emile]]'''
**How we got the [[First Pulses (Sept. 2015)]]
** and subsequently the [[First Echoes (Sept. 2015)]]

== '''[[:Category:Receiving|Receiving]]''' == 
*'''Objective'''
**Converting the analog data to digital data in a memory space 
*'''Requirements'''
**Protecting the receiving circuit
**Mastering TCG @HF
**Mastering selective gain @HF
**Getting the raw signal (5MHz based) sampled at at least 20/40MHz (if getting the signal) or to a frequency for acceptable sampling 
**Preprocessing the data using filters ? 
*'''Open Challenges'''
** A great read on the challenge awaiting the team in terms of board can be found at [[Challenge: the echOpen shield]]
*'''Tests with [[:Category:Emile | Emile]]'''
** A first approach using a Red Pitaya is described here : [[V0.0 Sprint log - Getting an image]] )
** Use of filters: A first go for [[:Category:Emile | Emile]] was at [[Compressing with FFT]]
