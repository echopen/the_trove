===Frame rate ''vs.'' number of lines===

Depending on the number of lines in an image, it is simple to determine the maximum frame rate accessible to a probe. This frame rate depend if we use a sweep mechanism of a rotary mechanism.

; Sweep mechanism

When we use a sweep mechanism, the image is done on the whole rotation of the motor, the maximum frame rate is given by:

 f_r = \dfrac{c}{2d_{max}N_l} = 18 fps. (1)

At contrary if we consider we want a frame rate at 10 fps, we can determine the maximum number of line at a given frame rate:

 N_l = \dfrac{c}{2d_{max}F_r} = 385 lines. (2)

; Rotary mechanism

With this kind of mechanism, the transducer make a whole turn when the motor do also a turn, so it can be used only during the given sector angle. So with only one transducer, the maximum frame rate is:

 f_r = \dfrac{c}{2d_{max}N_l}\dfrac{s}{2\pi} = 3 fps. (3)

So for our purpose, by using only one transducer, we must use a sweep mechanism to access a convenient frame rate.
