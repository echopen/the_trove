# Clipping test

{{PendingWork}}

== Context == 

The acquisition card used at the Emile stage is the [[The_case_for_Red_Pitaya|Red Pitaya]]. To get a maximum out of its measurement ranges, we need to use a signal input at +1/-1V.

However, the pulser, at the Emile Stage, provides the transducer with a roughly -30V pulse, and we listen to a ~190mV peak-to-peak signal. 

Hence, we want to clip the signal at +1V / -1V so that we can take a x20 (roughly) in resolution from the probe, so clip everything out of the signal that exceeds this 1V barrer.

== Schematics tried ==

=== 5MHZ clipping ===
