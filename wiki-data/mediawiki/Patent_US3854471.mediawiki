= Abstract =

A method and suggested apparatus for systematic search for and diagnosis of the populace particularly for the determination of tissue abnormalities and particularly the systematic analysis of breast tissue for abnormalities which includes an energy source with transmitter and receiver arranged to direct, project and receive a selected source of energy, such as ultrasonic radio frequencies or heat energy, into the area to be examined and to move and project and receive energy through a predetermined path while shifting and direction of projection or reception of energy through a plurality of directions such that the energy will be directed or received normally to or from the skin surface at, at least some portion of the motions or travel including means simultaneously to reveal, assess or measure the energy emitted to determine the presence of tissue abnormalities and upon such determination, to immediately, physically mark the location of such abnormality on the skin such that no additional translations in location are required and further to provide that the person being examined be positioned for a highly effective energy transfer and such mark being made in a position correlative to the location of the abnormality beneath the skin at surgery.
