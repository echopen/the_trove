= Abstract =

An examination of the human heart is carried out by means of ultrasound waves emitted by piezo-electric crystals. The crystals are inserted in a holder adapted to be placed on the body of a patient; they are arranged in a row and have parallel axes of radiation. The crystals are cyclically excited at a high scanning frequency, and the echo signals reflected by the heart walls and received by the crystals are displayed on the screen of a cathode ray tube to obtain a cross-sectional picture of the heart. In a modification of the invention, the holder comprises two or more rows of crystals radiating at different angles; in this case the echo signals related to a common point of the heart wall are superposed on the screen of the cathode ray tube by means of a coordinate transformation.
