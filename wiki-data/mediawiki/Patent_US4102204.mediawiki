= Abstract =

Moving section plane pictures of a specimen are produced by contacting a predetermined peripheral portion of an ultrasonic transducer head with the specimen in the section plane. The transducer head has a circular internal cavity in which a wheel is mounted eccentrically for rotation about an axis. A plurality of ultrasonic transducers are mounted peripherally on the wheel. The gap formed between a transducer and the internal surface of the transducer head is a minimum along the peripheral portion where contact to the specimen occurs. Each transducer is energized only when passing through the sector subtended by the peripheral portion in contact with the specimen and echoes received by the transducer are displayed on a screen whose base line is synchronized to the movement of the ultrasonic beam. The transducers can be divided into two sets alternately spaced around the wheel, each transducer of one set having a predetermined characteristic differing from the corresponding characteristic of the transducers of the second set. Depending upon the application, transducers of one or the other set are energized selectively or time averages may be obtained by alternate energization of the two sets.
