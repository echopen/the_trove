The circuit used for pulse generation is shown in Figure A-1.

The input to the pulser circuit
comes from the monostable, which is triggered by the output pulse generated by the Pulse
Generator module. The software-generated pulse triggers the active-high transition trigger
input (pin 2, which is input B, shown in Figure A-2) on the 74LS123 monostable. The
active-low transition trigger input (input A which is pin 1), is set low since it is not used,
while the active-low clear input (pin 3) is set high for the same reason. The width of the
output pulse (pin 13) is determined by the external capacitance and resistance at pins 14
and 15. In order to generate a pulse approximately 100 ns in width, a 10 kOhm resistor and a
12 pF capacitor are connected as shown in Figure A-2 [19].

The probe may be excited by either a positive or negative voltage (as long as the
difference in voltage between the two terminals of the transducer is enough to drive it).
The second part of the circuit shown in Figure A-1 actually generates the negative sharp
voltage pulse to the transducer [5]. When the Harris RFP8N20L N-channel logic-level FET
[8] is off (the default state), the high voltage 100 pF capacitor charges up to the positive
high voltage (155 V), via the charging resistor (12 kOhm).

The output of the monostable, a 5 V pulse, is used to turn the FET on. The use of a
TTL device to drive a high-voltage FET is the reason why a logic-level FET is used. These
FETs are fully turned on at logic-level voltages, whereas most high-voltage FETs require
significantly higher gate voltages in order to switch large voltages.
When the FET is turned on by the monostable output, the left side of the capacitor
is pulled to ground by the FET's source terminal. Pulling the left side of the capacitor to
ground causes a discharge on the right side of the capacitor, resulting in a large negative
voltage (approximately 155 V) applied to the top terminal of the transducer. Since the
bottom transducer terminal is at ground, the large negative voltage is applied across the
terminals of the transducer as the capacitor discharges. This idea can also be explained
mathematically.

When the FET is turned on, the voltage at the left terminal of the capacitor instantaneously
drops down (i.e., there is a negative step in voltage). With a negative voltage step ( V = -
u-1 (t) ), the current is proportional to an impulse (i=-C6(t)). This means that there is a
negative current spike across the capacitor, allowing it to discharge instantaneously. The
damping resistor (1 kQ) across the terminals of the transducer is used to shape the trailing
edge of the pulse. This resistor is set at a value large enough such that any received echoes
are not driven down (as would be the case with very small resistors that would effectively
short the terminals). Figure A-3 shows the negative high voltage pulse used to excite the
transducer.
The four high voltage Motorola 1N4004 diodes across the terminals of the transducer are used to protect the transducer from the positive voltage swing that occurs when the FET turns off and the capacitor begins to charge up again (the rising edge of the pulse shown in
Figure A-3). With the diodes, the voltage across the two terminals of the transducer can
never go higher than four diode drops (4*0.7 V = 2.8 V) above ground. 



A 10 Ohm resistor is
connected from the gate of the FET to ground to provide a path for the gate to discharge,
in order to reduce its turn-off time, and thus reduce the duration of the excitation pulse. A
small resistor value is used to decrease the FET's decay time (which is also influenced by
the input impedance of the FET).


== Receiver ==

Since the input impedance of the off-output transmitter circuit is governed by the damping
resistor (1 kQ) and the impedance of the transducer can be modeled as a capacitance of
value 0.0047 pF, the value of R in Figure A-4 is set to 5.6 kQ. There is a large drop
in voltage across the resistor, diminishing the need for high voltage diodes to protect the
receiver. The diodes used were standard 1N914 fast switching diodes.
In order to amplify the signal to the range governed by the D/A converter (Â±2 V), either
a high bandwidth operational amplifier or fast transistor amplifier can be used. The configuration of all of the external hardware required for a fully functional prototype ultrasound
system is shown in Figure A-5.
