The aim of the technical stake is to solve the question: how can we build an open-source portable echograph with a community?



== Hardware ==

Before starting, we recommend you get a read of [[:Category:HardIntro | Introduction to the echopen hardware]] to get to know the technical aspects and engineering behind the artifact.


== Kits and products ==

Given the nature of the product, a tool to be used by health professional, echopen is facing the issue of 

= Engineering =

Obviously, there are a couple of questions that are lurking around, such as:
* How to build an [[Open-source Hardware]] - what guidelines to be used?
** We had first guidelines on our [[Challenge:_the_echOpen_shield#Questions | first big challenge]]
** How to document on a wiki: it's easy to push code on github, much less with physical objects =) 
== Pending work ==
*Progress being done at the [[ENS]] with [[User:Constant_Bourdeloux | Constant]] : [[Carnet de bord - Laboratoire SATIE]] for the transducer [[EchOpen Transducer‎]]
*Some hacking of previous probes such as the [[ATL A6-3]], the [[S-VRW77AK]], or [[IR1510AK]] are on  [[Approche Hacking de l'existant]]: we do love [[:Category:Kretztechnik|Kretztechnik]] for the beauty, simplicity and robustness of their design !
