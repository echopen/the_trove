# First Pulses (Sept. 2015)

=Testing the transducers =

We have been recycling the following [[S-VRW77AK]] piezoelements. Color pairs are as follows: Yellow/DeepBlue, and Red/LightBlue.

After reconnecting the cables, the whole setup was installed in a plastic tube and waterproofed.

= Comparison =

== Using both transducers : RB and JB ==
=== Remarks ===
RB and JB stands for the two sets of cable linked to the pair of transducers, namely, RB for the Red and Blue, and JB for the Yellow/Blue pair.

The transducers differ in size, and it appears their behavior when the pulse is applied changes (the setup below shows the difference with a load resistance at 10kOhm, with a 10V tension applied) : 
* The peak reaches -1.03V for JB, -  0.65mV for RB -- > ''Why this level ?''
* JB present oscillations at T~5µs, RB are at 2.5µs

Similarities though:
*The width of the "gap" corresponds to the pulse driving the pulser system (roughly 19us) through the pwm. 
* The characteristic time for relaxation  is around 7 us

* Relaxation level seems to be -200mv for both transducers, at 22kOhm and 10V
* Small oscillations at 10ns / 10MHz -> ''Frequency of the transducer''? Possible as this was an endo

'''Conclusion''': RB could be the most interesting to study, as we have more amplitude.

== 10kOhm vs 22kOhm ==
=== Remarks on JB uses ===
Similarities wise:
*Structure of the measurement is the same, apart from the following below:

We can see, that, difference-wise:
*Peak level reaches -1.48V for 30V and 22k,  -3.02 for 30V and 10kOhm
*The secondary oscillations are for 22k, 5us, and 2.5us for 10kOhm -> it seems that the resistance of JB is therefore half of that of RB, as the behavior changes in a similar fashion.
*We therefore seem to have a better SNR
