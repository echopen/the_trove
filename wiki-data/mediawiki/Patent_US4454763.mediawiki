= Abstract =

A rotary ultrasonic scan head includes a housing 10 consisting of generally symmetrical housing portions 10A and 10B having respective mating surfaces 14 and 16 that abut when the housing portions are assembled. A cavity is defined within the housing by recesses 18, 27, 34 and 38 in housing portion 10A and by complementary recesses 20, 28, 36 and 40 in housing portion 10B, by boot 50 disposed on the housing portions in assembly, and by pressure-compensating diaphragm member 42 disposed within the housing portions in assembly. A rotor 12 including a plurality of ultrasonic transducers 22, an impeller 24, and an optically encoded member 26 is supported for rotation within this cavity. An acoustic coupling and driving fluid is supplied to and withdrawn from the cavity through fluid inlet bore 68 and fluid outlet bore 70 in housing portion 10A, with the fluid entering the cavity being directed at impeller 24. A rotary transformer couples electrical signals between housing portion 10A and the rotor, and a plurality of reed switches within the rotor and permanent magnets 94 and 96 disposed in housing portion 10A commutate these electrical signals so that each transducer is enabled only when that transducer is traversing a desired sector. Fiber-optic bundles 108 and 110 disposed in housing portion 10B optically couple member 26 to external light sources and detectors so that the relative angular position, speed of rotation, and direction of rotation of the rotor can be determined.
