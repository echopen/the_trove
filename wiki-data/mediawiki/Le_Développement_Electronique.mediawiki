Hi John,

Thanks for the reply.

Actually, I have found a document talking about building the high voltage
power supply ( HVPS, 100V-1000V, please find the related document PDF in
the attachement)

So, can you tell us your opinion on  this article ?  Do you think that we
can use this circuit to build our HVPS systeme for the transducers? For me
it seems simple and practicable.


But as we don't have all the components at the moment, so I can't test it
immediately, I am trying to use some simulation softeware to simulate the
output,  do you use any simulation software  as well ?


Best regards,

Na

Hi Na.

It is an interesting variation on the boost converter. You will need to estimate how much current you need. One way is to look at the properties of the piezo transducer and work from that. We don't take that approach. We just look at the pulse we drive the transducer with and estimate the current per pulse, which is usually quite high. This "peak" current is then averaged out over the number of times per second the transducer is pulsed, and then you have an estimate of the current required from your power supply. Double it just to  make sure.

The boost converter calculator I directed you to allows you to choose an output current. With the design you sent me you will need to work it out for yourself.

In any event, It looks like you could use the circuit, as long as you get the necessary current. Depending on your application, you may not need a very high voltage. Piezo transducers are usually very sensitive as receivers, and you can get useful results from lower transducer driving voltages.

I do not know anything about your transducer or application, but there is one other thing you need to keep in mind. Piezo materials are polarized and for transducer applications usually vibrate in a length expansion/contraction mode. You need to make sure that the electric transmit pulse you apply to the transducer initially causes it to contract, not expand. This will avoid the transducer degrading quickly.

Present work of Na.
====Test of the motor ====
The connection of the arduino and the motor can be found in the site DIGILENT [http://www.digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,401,503&Prod=PMOD-HB5]

[[File:motor connection.jpg | 600 px]]

As we haven't the Motor shield, we build a simple motor control circuit thanks to this blog [https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-13-dc-motors/overview]
So the composants that we need are:
1, resistor 220 kOhms x1 
2, Transistor PN2222 x1
3, 1N4001 diode x1
4, 270 Ω Resistor (red, purple, brown stripes) x1
5, Half-size Breadboard x1
6, Jumper wire pack

Now build the circuit pour the motor!

In order to make it more clear for others to test the motor, a page much clear is made here [http://echopen.org/index.php?title=Prototype]
and I tested the boost supply on NI software multisim.

(i)Reply to the question on wednesday :

1, reply from John : 

Have to use this site [https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-boost-calc/the-calculator] to calculator the parameters; You need this to set up the circuit, but you then need to tweak the circuit to get good performance.

We do not use a large capacitor on the output - this will lower the output voltage for any significant output current. I actually have one of these circuits as part of an ultrasonic system I  am debugging at the moment. I am using a 500 KHz driving frequency, 12 vdc in, a 6.8 uH inductor, and a 0.001 uf output capacitor (more for noise suppression than filtering the output in our case). We can get 300 vdc from the circuit. Our output current was designed to be about 20 mA. The online calculator indicated that 10 uH was the inductance we needed, but experimentally we found that 6.8 uH gave a higher output (nearly 100 volts more).

Keep in mind that Rds (drain source resistance in the ON condition) of the mosfet is important. Lower is better: try for < 1 Ohm.. Also the choice of inductor type is important. We use a high current surface mount inductor from Epcos, see RS Components http://au.rs-online.com/web/, part 4961915.

Duty cycle seems to have little effect, and we usually use a 50/50 duty cycle. "

2, Reply from [http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/189862/problem-in-a-boost-calculator-circuit] :

The Maximum Repetitive Reverse Voltage of the 1N5817 is 20V and no-doubt your simulator will take this into account. This means that you cannot create an output any greater than 20V. Think about it - to generate 300V, that diode has to be able to withstand a reverse breakdown voltage of at least 300 volts.

Another problem is that in 0.5 msecs the inductors current will have reached 2.27 amps and you are expecting a 1A diode to pass that energy thru to the output capacitors: -

V = L di/dt therefore di = V dt/L = 10×0.00050.0022 = 2.27 amps.

the 2.27 amps is the current attained thru the inductor when the MOSFET is switched on for 0.5 msecs - this current is then forced to flow thru the 1N5817 when the transistor open circuits. Clearly you are exceeding the limits on the diode twice.

Next, the IRFD110 is only rated to have 100V max on drain wrt source so you can never get 300V without damage. Also, with an on resistance of 0.54 ohms and an avarage current of maybe 1A when conducting, the losses are going to be noteworthy if not excessive.

so, recalculate the parametres and change the diodes.

500Khz, 0-9v input - >　40v output

[[File:9v-40v-500khz.png | 900 px]]


Problems rest :

Actually it works when I changed the minmum input to 9V, and the diode (because I think that the maximum repetitive reverse voltage of the 1N5817 is 20V, so we can't get an output more than 20 ?) and it takes time to get to 30V ? nearly one minustes in my computer. 

Another problem is that our microcontrecoller only  have an output of -1V~1V,  so it seems donn't work so well as a boost  input.


Finally, a question very important to us is that :   in order to drive the piezo, we need an -30v~ 0v negative square wave, while this boost calculator only give an output of high voltage DC. How to solve this problem, to convert the 30v DC to -30v square wave with a certain bandwidth?


(ii)Test the basic operational amplificator through NI multisim.

100hz, input :1V ; output : 10V

100hz, input :1V ; output limited to : 12V

100hz, input :1V ; output limited to : 14V

LMH6629 [http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmh6629.pdf]  

[[File:500khz-1v-11v.png | 900 px ]]

Maxim output is -14v~+14v limited to the power supply.

so a better choice is : MAX4805 [http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/amplifiers/MAX4805.html]
