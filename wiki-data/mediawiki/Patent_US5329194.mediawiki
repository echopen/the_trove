= Abstract =

An ultrasonic probe has a housing, a base pivotally mounted within the housing, an extension formed upon the base, and a scanning ultrasonic transducer disposed upon the distal end of the extension. The extension is preferably configured such that the scanning transducer moves along an arc of approximately 50 degrees having a radius of approximately 40 mm and is thus suitable for imaging elongate anatomical structures such as portions of the peripheral vascular system. A doppler ultrasonic transducer fixedly disposed within the housing proximate the scanning ultrasonic transducer measures fluid flow within the elongate anatomical structure. The doppler ultrasonic transducer is disposed at one end of the arc along which the scanning ultrasonic transducer travels such that the radiation path of the doppler ultrasonic transducer is periodically obscured by the scanning ultrasonic transducer. The doppler ultrasonic transducer measures fluid flow through the elongate anatomical structure when the scanning ultrasonic transducer is not within the radiation path of the doppler ultrasonic transducer.
