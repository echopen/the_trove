= Abstract =

A real time method and apparatus is disclosed for scanning large body areas to produce an ultrasound cross-sectional picture of a body in which method at least two different and partially overlapping sector scans of the body are carried out in one scanning plane by the pulse-echo method utilizing single ultrasound array. The array is rotatable about an axis of rotation perpendicular to the scanning plane and comprises at least a first and a second transducer, disposed in spaced relationship along a circle which is situated in the scanning plane and which is concentric with the axis of rotation. Out of at least two different scans, one is performed with the first transducer and the other with the second, each transducer being used both for the emission of ultrasound pulses and for the reception of echo waves and the position of the axis of rotation with respect to the body remaining unchanged during all the scans.
