*The cMUT in medical applications

One of the candidate technologies to advance state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging is the use of a capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (cMUT). With cMUT, ultrasound imaging could overcome some of the limits inherent in currently used technology, bringing higher lateral and axial resolution, higher speed, and even real-time 3D (or 4D) imaging to new and improved diagnostic applications for areas such as ophthalmology, dermatology, and
cardiology

== Intro ==

The idea of using arrays of micromachined transducers for medical imaging is not new. R&D has been going on in labs around throughout the world for more than two decades,  leading to proof-of-concept designs and even operational 2D arrays of cMUT cells with integrated electronics.

But only recently have the production processes and tools have become available to produce full-scale high-performance cMUT devices:  techniques to micromachine thousands to millions of microsized cMUT cells together with CMOS chips that are powerful enough to drive these cells and to read them. Today, the technology even allows the cMUT layer to be integrated monolithically directly on top of the CMOS, fabricating them as a single chip. This allows the realization of very large 2D arrays (e.g., 100 × 100 elements) operating at rather high frequencies (tens of MHz), which is not possible with conventional bulk piezoelectric transducers.

== Ultrasounds with bulk piezoelectric transducers ==

Ultrasound imaging (sonography) uses high-frequency sound waves of a few MHz to a few tens of MHz to view soft tissues such as muscles and internal organs. Since the first ultrasound systems were introduced, the number of potential applications and image quality has grown steadily. Because the technique is noninvasive and the sound waves are nonionizing, it is now an essential tool in routine clinical practice.

In a typical ultrasound exam, a handheld transducer is placed against the skin. The transducer sends out high-frequency sound waves that penetrate and reflect off of the body tissues and structures. The returning sound waves, or echoes, are captured and reconstructed as an image. That reconstruction is done based on the frequencies and strengths (amplitudes) of the returned signals and the time it takes for them to return to the transducer.

The crucial component to any ultrasound system is the ultrasound transducer. This is a device with an array of elements or acoustic pixels. Each pixel converts electrical energy to acoustic energy (i.e. the ultrasound waves) and vice versa. The number and the size of the acoustic pixels determine the imaging resolution, contrast, and field of view achievable with a transducer array. In general, a higher number of smaller pixels result in better resolution and contrast.

Today, conventional ultrasound transducers are based on one row of 64–256 elements made from piezoelectric ceramic materials. Further reducing the dimensions of these cells and increasing their numbers has a serious impact on the complexity of the fabrication of the transducers. In other words: there is an economical and technological limit to the realization of high-frequency and 2D arrays. And the latter are essential for generating high-resolution 3D and 4D images (3D moving in real-time).

Micromachined transducer systems such as cMUTs overcome the fabrication limitations of these bulk piezoelectric-based transducers.

== An orchestra with thousands of little drums ==

In cMUT technology, each cell resembles an ultrasmall drum. These drums are made by micromachining on a silicon substrate. Each drum consists of a cavity over which a thin membrane is suspended. The bottom of the cavity and the membrane act as electrodes. If an AC signal superimposed on a DC bias is applied across the electrodes of a cMUT drum, the membrane starts to vibrate at a frequency close to the resonance frequency of the membrane, thereby generating ultrasonic sound waves in the medium around the cMUT. Conversely, if ultrasonic sound waves hit the surface of the membrane, it also starts to vibrate, thereby generating an AC electrical signal. In other words, cMUT cells can act both as a transmitter and as a receiver for ultrasound.

With micromachining, the manufacturing complexity of the ultrasound transducer does not depend on the ultrasound frequency of the application that is targeted. It is sufficient to vary the lateral dimension of the membranes and the thickness of the dielectric and metallic films to achieve a cMUT operating in the desired frequency band. High-resolution imaging needs frequencies of the order of 1 to 30MHz, requiring cells (and membranes) with lateral dimensions in the order of tens of microns and the thicknesses of a few microns.

These cells are typically grouped in elements, each having a few tens of cells. Such an element is the acoustic pixel (axel) of the ultrasound sensor. These axels are in their turn organized as 1D or 2D arrays. An example of a small 1D array, consisting of eight elements, fabricated at imec is shown in the Figure 2.

All of these elements and their cells must be interconnected with the front-end circuitry that drives them and reads out the echoed ultrasound. To minimize the effects of the parasitic capacitances induced by the interconnections, it is preferable to have the front-end circuitry as close as possible to the cMUT element. But even if cables with smaller capacitances are used, it is very challenging, if not impossible, to address all of the array elements in a large cMUT array and to route the bundle of cables to the electronics. This interconnection challenge can be solved through monolithically integrating the fabrication of the cMUT and front-end circuitry.



==CMUT imaging in medical==

High-frequency, high-resolution transducers are potentially easier to fabricate with cMUT technology, which could make ultrasound available for a wider range of applications. Also it could make high-end applications more cost-effective for every point of care.

In ultrasound imaging, more details can be visualized as the frequency and bandwidth of the ultrasound waves are increased. A 10 MHz transducer with a 10 MHz bandwidth frequency response, and excited with a one-cycle sine wave pulse at 10 MHz, for example, results in an axial resolution of approximately 200 µm in the human body. Recent developments of high-frequency arrays of transducers (up to and above 15 MHz) have therefore allowed the use of ultrasound for new applications such as ophthalmology or heart disease diagnosis, albeit at a high cost.

In ophthalmology, for example, ultrasound imaging allows the study of the internal structures of the eye and orbit. It is indispensable in those diseases in which it is not possible to optically observe the inner structures of the eye, such as the retina or the vitreous body, because of opacities of anterior structures (cornea, lens). Since the ocular structures are very small, it is necessary to operate at very high frequencies, in the range of 20 to 50 MHz. But because there are only a few ultrasound transducer arrays operating at frequencies above 20 MHz, hospitals use mechanical scanning probes in which a high-frequency ultrasonic transducer is physically rotated by a mechanical system. This, however, limits the scanning speed to around 20 Hz.

Ultrasound imaging is also one of the diagnostic tools of choice for heart diseases. The first cardiac ultrasound devices could only acquire a single image line at a time (referred to as “M-mode” acquisition). With this, doctors could study the basic morphological properties of the heart such as the dimension of the left ventricular cavity or the thickness of the segmental wall. In addition, the motion of the heart during the cardiac cycle could be monitored. However, as the field-of-view of this imaging approach remained very limited, correct navigation through the heart and interpretation of the recordings were difficult. Therefore, 2D ultrasound imaging (“B-mode” imaging) was introduced by mechanically moving (i.e. tilting) the transducer between subsequent line acquisitions. This mechanical motion of the transducer was later replaced by electronic beam steering when phased-array transducer technology was introduced. Cross-sectional images of the heart can now be produced at typical frame rates of about 30 Hz.

Since then, the image quality and image resolution have continuously improved. An ultrasound probe was made, for example, with a 2D piezoelectric array closely interconnected to application specific integrated circuits capable of performing part of the signal processing in the probe itself. With monolithic cMUT technology, this integration would be included in the chip package, with less fabrication complexity and at a lower cost.

One approach of integrating the front-end electronics with the cMUT array (i.e. monolithic integration) is to fabricate both the driving and readout electronics together with the cMUT structure on the same substrate wafer. This will lead to a better cMUT performance compared to other integration schemes. That is, there is a better signal-to-noise ratio through a reduced interconnect parasitic resistance and capacitance, a smaller die size and package, and lower power consumption. Such a monolithic approach is especially suited for applications like cMUTS, where performance and miniaturization are of key importance, and where hundreds of thousands or even millions interconnections are needed between the cMUT array and a CMOS chip.

But monolithic integration is complex and challenging. Various technologies, design expertise, application knowledge, and fabrication capabilities have to collaborate more closely than routinely done in either CMOS or MEMS (microelectromechanical system) fabrication.

imec has implemented an innovative approach to the monolithic integration of MEMS structures such as the cMUTs. In this approach, imec fabricates the cMUT structures on a planarized wafer after the CMOS process has been completed. The cMUT processing and characteristics are made independent of the CMOS technology with which they are combined.

==Addressing temperature limitations==

A consequence of this method, however, is that the maximum process temperature is limited to around 450°C because higher temperatures would damage the underlying CMOS. Therefore, imec sets up its cMUT technology platform and baseline process on 200-mm wafers making use of poly-silicon-germanium (poly-SiGe), a material that can be processed at these temperatures and that has mechanical properties for attaining reliable and robust MEMS.

This SiGeMEMS platform allows for implementing all known cMUT design flavors from the literature, such as uniform and bossed devices, with single and dual electrodes, and in transmit and receive modes.  The consistent description of the modal resonant equivalent circuit; the transduction between electrical, mechanical, and acoustic domains; and the proper description of the acoustic load are key parts of the imec model.

On the technology platform, imec has successfully built and tested cMUT devices operating at frequencies in the 2- to 10-MHz range. Through a unique stitching capability, imec is able to produce very large cMUT arrays, the size of which is only limited by the wafer size. In addition, imec has the capabilities for prototype fabrication, reliability testing, acoustic testing and characterization, packaging, and small volume fabrication.

==Conclusion==

cMUT technology, especially when monolithically integrated with the CMOS driving and readout chip, offers unique possibilities for medical ultrasound imaging. It could be the basis of cost-effective ultrasound transducers that bring current state-of-the-art techniques to point-of-care applications. And it could advance the field of high-speed, high-resolution visualization along with 3D/4D medical imaging.
