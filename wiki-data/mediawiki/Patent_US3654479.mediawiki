= Abstract =

An apparatus for producing an output signal which is representative of the phase shift between two signals. Two input signals are used to generate a sawtooth signal which is compared to a reference sawtooth signal. The instantaneous amplitude difference between the sawtooth generated by the input and the reference sawtooth is proportional to the phase difference of these signals and an output representative of the phase difference is produced by the apparatus. The output signal can be used, for instance, to control the speed of rotation of an object.
