Commercial transducer
---------------------

We are using a commercial transducer with a center frequency of 5 MHz
which has an impedance **Z** defined by:

-   Re(Z) = 9.29 Ohms
-   Im(Z) = -12.5 Ohms

With our electronic circuit we access to pulse of amplitude given by the
VCC (here 20 V):

![ center| 400 px](raw_pulse.png " center| 400 px")

the rise time is 420 ns. Ideally, we want a pulse with a duration of 100
ns (half the period of the transducer) with an amplitude of -100 V.

When we plug the transducer, the pulse change:

![ center| 400 px](transducer_pulse.png " center| 400 px")

the amplitude of the pulse is now -12.8 V and the rise time is 5.4 us.
The impedance of the transducer reduce the amplitude of the pulse and
increase the rise time. By knowing the equivalent electronic circuit we
could design the electronic circuit to access the desire pulse.

Example of recycling transducers
--------------------------------

### Testing the Red and Yellow transducers

We have been recycling the following [S-VRW77AK](S-VRW77AK "wikilink")
piezoelements. Color pairs are as follows: Yellow/DeepBlue, and
Red/LightBlue.

After reconnecting the cables, the whole setup was installed in a
plastic tube and waterproofed.
