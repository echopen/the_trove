    -   CapTech Workshop. Was great!
    -   Acted upon a split between a FPGA long-term approach, and a
        non-FPGA one. I remembered those good old times when this was
        a possibility.
    -   Damn it. What if I could dig into this? Not ÂµC, rather an
        extension for an existing computer.. or mini computer.
    -   Saw some ideas on the Arduino's side. Separate ADC.

        -   For low-speed comms, conventional I2C or similar protocols
            can be used, and there is no need to use a PRU. For
            high-speed comms the PRU may be extremely useful because it
            can service the hardware with no interruptions due to Linux
            context switching, and no overhead is experienced by the
            main ARM processor. Here are some examples that should be
            feasible; basically quite a few possibilities, such as
            **interfacing to a fast ADC (e.g. analog capture)**,
    -   <https://theembeddedkitchen.net/beaglelogic-building-a-logic-analyzer-with-the-prus-part-1/449>
        BBB is a 100MHz logic analyzer on a BeagleBoneBlack
    -   Demo over the <http://beaglelogic.github.io/webapp/>
    -   <http://r.git.net/beagleboard/2013-10/msg00204.html>
        -   Can the PRU be used to interface the Beaglebone to external
            ADC? I need to capture 500 micro-seconds of data at a 5
            MHz rate.
        -   -&gt; *It depends on the interface to the ADC. There is a
            parallel capture interface that will easily run that fast,
            and you may be able to use the bit-shift interface to do
            serial or something like SPI if the PRU's capability lines
            up with what your ADC wants to see.*
    -   <http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui>
        -   *In its current state, it grabs analog data from an ADC, and
            dumps it into memory on the BBB, ready to be displayed or
            further processed. It could be used for gathering analog
            information from sensors, CCDs or other data
            acquisition use-cases. To be reasonably useful, the desire
            was for it to support 20Mbytes/sec of data or more. It does
            achieve this, but it is for further study to find higher
            speed methods.*
        -   *This is not such a bad idea, because in future the ADC
            could be swapped out to a (say) 10-bit ADC with no code
            change on the PRU.*
        -   **Once the data has been captured (2000 samples in this
            example), the command byte is acknowledged, so that the
            Linux hosted application can know that the PRU
            has completed. The PRU now sits and waits for a new
            instruction from the Linux hosted application.** -&gt; works
            for us - fixed depth = fixed \# of samples
    -   Buffer to be used : detailed at
        <http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui>
        -   ''These were extremely important for two reasons. One reason
            is that the pins to the BBB that I wished to use need to be
            isolated during power-up, because they are used for
            selecting the boot method. If there was any unusual level on
            the pins upon power-up then the BBB will not boot from
            the eMMC. So, a tri-state buffer is needed. The other reason
            is that there is a fair bit of capacitance and it is highly
            likely that the ADC may not be able to directly drive the
            pins at high speed. I actually came across this problem
            while trying to connect a camera to the BBB. I struggled for
            days without realising that the camera could not support
            the load. So, the buffers are likely to be essential for
            most designs using the pins that were selected. I used a
            74LVC244A device as a buffer. Note that the clock also needs
            a buffer, unless significant jitter is acceptable. No
            tri-state is required here, so I used a MC74VHC1GT50.

|         spruh73c.pdf One thought I had was  |                              |
|         to use both PRUs to capture         |                              |
|         alternate bytes/words but that was  |                              |
|         just a thought, again are all the   |                              |
|         pins available?                     |                              |
|     -   I'd made a mistake, it looks like   |                              |
|         all of PRU0's GPI pins may be       |                              |
|         available, if we are happy to lose  |                              |
|         the microSD (no big loss - there    |                              |
|         are other ways to get data in/out   |                              |
|         of the BBB). So, we can             |                              |
|         theoretically get high-res captures |                              |
|         up to about 15bits, if we need 1    |                              |
|         pin for the clock.                  |                              |
