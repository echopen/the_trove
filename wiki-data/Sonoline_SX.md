Vidoson 735
===========

\
Transducer for mechanical linear scanner (Vidoson 735) Rotating
transducer mount with three identical periodically-activated
transmitters for the Vidoson 735 series. The elliptic shape of the
transducer is a consequence of the opto-acoustical characteristics of
the corresponding parabolic reflector.\
