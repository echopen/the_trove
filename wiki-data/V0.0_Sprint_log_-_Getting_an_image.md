Quick and dirty

Tuesday 22nd
------------

After a WiFi problem, we shifted the Pitaya to the main room with the
oscillo to do the tests. We ...

-   went shopping, despite rain and fleet, and discovered
    [HackSpark](http://hackspark.fr);
-   built a housing for the probe: motor and collector were reused, from
    the elements of the [IR1510AK](IR1510AK "wikilink") probe;
-   reviewed the booster, according to an article
    ([Thadani](Thesis:_Thadani,_MIT,_1997 "wikilink") et al);
-   refactored an old probe piezzo ([S-VRW77AK](S-VRW77AK "wikilink"));
-   synced the RedPitaya acquisition to an external trigger
    (the arduino).

Soft so far

### Files

All is there : [repo
github](https://github.com/kelu124/rechOpen/tree/master/UDP%20Tool)

### How to use

-   UDP\_receive.py has to run before executing the server - it listens
    on the right UDP port and dumps the packets, decoded, into the
    corresponding log file in data/
    -   For example, 20151004-185450\_UDP-DATA.log stores a packet
        per line. Each 16k points line in the raw data was squared,
        clipped, averaged over 16 points samples, resulting in a 1024
        points echo line.
    -   Each 1024 points line was splitted over 256 points packets, plus
        the 7 first ints bearing additional information (right now, the
        critical data are the position of the packet in the line, in
        Col1, the line number, in Col5, and the position of the servo
        in Col4)
    -   So 1024 points are splitted over 4 packets of size (256+7)
        (sizeof(int), so the total is around 1098 bytes.
-   To obtain these lines, one must compile the src/CreateImage16s.c
    using the ./run.sh tool included in the SDK.
    -   After launching, it should print the status of data transfer
    -   One should see the progress in parallel displayed by
        UDP\_receive.py
-   LogParser.py takes a log file and creates the corresponding PNG file
    -   Beware, appropriate libraries should be included, like Image

### Disclaimer

After a couple of issues with the Red Pitaya web app, we have tried to
set up a UDP server on the Pitaya.

The first trials were done with **/srcTestServer.c** -- but we were
still quite buggy, especially in terms of memory management, which
proved quite tricky for a C n00b like me.

Moreover, I think that the UDP data rate, at least with the Pitaya, are
note quite compatible with the data rate in terms of raw images. The
time being, I rather focused on delivering an image.

Structure
---------

The setup consists in :

-   a server, ie CreateImage16s.c (which sends averages of 16s).
    -   I removed the triggerdelay from the RP to avoid loosing to much
        time waiting for a second pulse for the PMW -- I'm just taking
        what I need to know where the motor is.
    -   Using the SDK, an executable in /tmp/api\_test will appear on
        the RP. It can be safely executed from there.
    -   Over the 16k samples, it takes the sums of the squares
-   It packs at the moment 256 samples, on 4 bytes int, plus 7 int
    bearing information (motor, date, time elapsed, ...) on each packet.
-   UDP client, in Python.
    -   It unpacks the data coming through the UDP and processes the
        packet "header"
    -   It stores the packets in a .log file, which can be used to
        replay the capture
-   A LogParser, which interprets a log file, repacks the different
    parts of a same line, sorts the lines according to their positions
    as encoded on the single int left, an shoots a png that represents
    the capture

So far, I canceled working on the createref.py tool, to remove the
baseline from all the signals

HowTo // Protocole
------------------

-   Starting python UDP\_receiver.py
-   Launching the acquisition through CreateImage16s
-   Shutting down UDPReceiver
-   Unpacking the corresponding log using the Parser.py
-   Admiring the newly formed PNG image

TODO
----

-   Sending RawData (sampled at 125MHZ) through UDP.
-   Having the Pitaya broadcast its messages, instead of streaming them
    to the main computer (INANYADDR)
-   Having a pitaya emulator replay the log files in a local C
    UDP server.
-   Artificial TCG in the LogParser\*
-   Forgetting, it's getting late.
