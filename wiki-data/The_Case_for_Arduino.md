The latest in the range which we present here is the Teensy 3.1. It
sports a powerful 32bit Cortex M4 processor running at 72Mhz in a
package a little smaller than a stick of gum. Don't let the size fool
you. It manages to provide a whopping 34 digital IO pins, 21 of which
can work as analog inputs and 12 include PWM capability. That's a lot of
processing power and extensibility in a very small board.

The XuLA2-LX9 is built to provide just the things you need so you can
spend your time adding the features you want. It crams a 600,000-gate
FPGA, 32 MByte SDRAM, 8 Mbit Flash, microSD memory card, two voltage
regulators and a supervisory microcontroller into a 2" x 1" footprint
(51 mm x 25 mm for you metric guys).
