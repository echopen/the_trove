The wiki principles
===================

A wiki is ... **The simplest online database that could possibly work.**

A wiki is a web site that lets any visitor become a participant: you can
create or edit the actual site contents without any special technical
knowledge or tools. All you need is a computer with an Internet
connection. A wiki is continuously “under revision.” It is a living
collaboration whose purpose is the sharing of the creative process and
product by many. One famous example is Wiki-pedia, an online
encyclopedia with no “authors” but millions of contributors and editors.

How to add information
======================

### Key 'tags' to the pages

Each page that is created should clearly indicate the category in which
it is intended to be used, for exemple a technical part should be
categorized as:

-   Hardware
-   Software

Then, depending on the corresponding level of development, it should
indicate on what Kit / prototype this information is linked, at this
stage for example should be tagged with:

-   [Emile](:Category:Emile "wikilink")
-   [Protaud](:Category:Protaud "wikilink")
-   [Michaud](:Category:Michaud "wikilink")
-   [Neaud](:Category:Neaud "wikilink")

Finally, it should as well indicate the specifics of the Category, for
example, working on creating a pulse for the transducer at the Emile
stage would be tagged as:

`[[Category:Hardware]] [[Category:Emission]] [[Category:Transducer]] [[Category:Emile]]`

### Using templates

A nice "Pending work" alert can be displayed using the {{PendingWork}}
code.

This will also list the page as in *PendingWork* mode, meaning that the
page is not finished. The current list of these pages can be found under
<Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:PendingWork>.

### What are categories?

Categories, a powerful software feature of our wiki, provide automatic
indexes that are useful as tables of contents.

You can categorize pages and files by adding one or more Category tags
to the content text. These tags create links at the bottom of the page
that take you to the list of all pages in that category, which makes it
easy to browse related articles.

Each of the pages in the **Category**
[namespace](Special:MyLanguage/Help:Namespaces "wikilink") represents a
so-called **category**, a grouping of related pages, and contains an
index for the pages of its category. For example, this page belongs to
"[:Category:Help](:Category:Help "wikilink")". If you open the
"[:Category:Help](:Category:Help "wikilink")" page, you will see a link
to this page there.

When a page belongs to one or more categories, these categories appear
at the bottom of the page. The category pages themselves contain 2
parts:

-   at their beginning, an optional part may contain text that can be
    edited, like any other page,
-   at their end, an ever present, automatically generated, alphabetical
    list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. (In fact,
    in ASCII order. See [Help:Special
    pages](Help:Special_pages "wikilink")).

To assign a category to a page, simply add the link
"\[\[Category:*Category name*\]\]" to the page's wikitext. The usual
place to add it is at the bottom of the page.

To link a category page within a page as a normal wiki link (without
adding the page to the category), prefix the link name with a colon. For
example: \[\[:Category:Not in this category\]\]

New categories can be [created](Help:Starting_a_new_page "wikilink")
before assigning any page to it, in the same way as any other regular
page.

-   For a complete list of all categories which have at least one page,
    see <Special:Categories>.
-   For a complete list of all created/edited categories, including the
    ones that don't have any pages, see <Special:Allpages/Category:>
    (note the colon at the end).

How can I contribute to the Maintenance
=======================================

Since so many contributors can participate to the wiki, it is necessary
to regularly review the structure of the content that has been posted.
This can include:

-   Pruning categories: <Special:Categories> by removing the
    corresponding little-used Categories.
-   Linking to Orphan pages at <Special:LonelyPages> so to move them out
    of this list.
-   Creating links out of the
    [:Special:DeadendPages](:Special:DeadendPages "wikilink")
-   Categorize <Special:UncategorizedPages>

<Category:Help>
