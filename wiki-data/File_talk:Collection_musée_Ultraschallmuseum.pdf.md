Ian Donald (December 1910 – 19 June 1987) was a Scottish physician who
pioneered the use of diagnostic ultrasound in medicine. Whilst Professor
of Midwifery at Glasgow University, he first explored the use of
ultrasound in the 1950s after seeing it used in the Glasgow shipyards to
look for flaws in metallurgy. He became Regius Professor of Midwifery in
1955. His article Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed
Ultrasound, published 7 June 1958 in the medical journal The Lancet, was
one of the defining publications in the field. Ultrasound has become an
important aid to diagnosing foetal progress during pregnancy.
